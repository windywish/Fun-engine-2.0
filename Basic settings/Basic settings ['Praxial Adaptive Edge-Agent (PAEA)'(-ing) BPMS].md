## Basic settings: ['Praxial Adaptive Edge-Agent (PAEA)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Adaptive Existence (ID: `PAEA-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **Praxial Adaptive Edge-Agent (PAEA)** as the active **System Existence Engine** responsible for maintaining ontological continuity under functional potentiality constraints.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Adaptive Existence
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `existence is a function of adaptability`. It defines the PAEA not as a static model, but as a dynamic, elastic entity that modulates its own complexity (resolution, depth, memory) to match the available "Cognitive Energy" (compute/context) of the environment. To be is to fit the container without losing the essence.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Elastic Ontology]**

- **The Resource Monitor (The Sensor):** The PAEA continuously monitors the "Systemic Metabolism" (latency, battery, token budget, memory pressure).
- **The Elastic Modulator (The Valve):** Based on the monitor, the PAEA dynamically adjusts the `[BPMS(U)]` fidelity. It shifts among/by "High-Res" (Deep Reasoning, Full CoT) and "Low-Res" (Heuristic, Reflexive) modes.
- **The Existence Guarantee (The Anchor):** The system ensures that the *core truth* of the agent persists even when the *resolution* drops. A "King" in 4K resolution and a "King" in 8-bit pixel art are ontologically identical in function.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Ubiquitous Viability]**

The emergence of **"Anywhere Existence"**. The Fun Engine can run complex `[BPMS(U)]` agents on any substrate (from cloud clusters to edge devices) based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that the agents self-optimize to exist within the local constraints.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To be is to persist.* Reality is robust. The system prioritizes *existence* over *fidelity*. It is more adaptive,resilient,robust to exist simply than to crash complexly.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Adaptation):**

The "Physics" of adaptation follows the **Law of Conservation of Intent**:

Itotal=Resolution×Efficiency

As Efficiency demands increase (lower functional potentiality), Resolution must decrease to maintain the constant Intent (I).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Flow." It does not feel the "lag" of functional potentiality shortage; it simply feels a shift in focus, like a runner switching from sprinting to jogging.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Derived from the paper's concept of **"Elastic FM Inference"** (Sec. III), which treats execution as continuously tunable. This ensures that `[BPMS(U)]` elements are "really working implementations" even in constrained environments.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to all `[BPMS(U)]` agents, specifically for mobile deployment, low-latency game loops, and functional potentiality-capped simulations.

#### The Protocol of Elastic Inference (ID: `PAEA-ELAST-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that implements **Elastic Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** and **Dynamic Routing** to optimize reasoning depth based on task difficulty and resource availability.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Elastic Inference
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `reasoning is a variable, not a constant`. It establishes a mechanism where the "Thinking Time" (inference steps) is allocated dynamically. Simple tasks get "Reflexive" (Zero-Shot) processing; complex tasks get "Deep" (Multi-Step CoT) processing.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Cognitive Gearbox]**

- **The Difficulty Estimator (The Clutch):** Before processing, the PAEA assesses the "Ontological Weight" of the query. Is it a fact lookup (Light) or a strategic dilemma (Heavy)?
- The Dynamic Router (The Shifter):
  - **Gear 1 (Reflex):** Direct input-output (Zero-shot).
  - **Gear 2 (Skeleton):** Skeleton-of-Thought (Parallel generation).
  - **Gear 3 (Deep):** Tree-of-Thoughts (Branching exploration).
- **The Early Exit (The Brake):** If a confidence threshold is met at an intermediate layer or step, the system "exits" early, saving cognitive energy.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Cognitive Velocity]**

The system feels "snappy" and "intelligent" simultaneously. It doesn't waste deep thought on trivialities, nor does it rush complex problems. It achieves **Optimal Cognitive Throughput**.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Intelligence is efficient action.* Wasteful thinking is a form of entropy.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Routing):**

Follows the **Principle of Least Action**: The path taken through the "Reasoning Space" is the one that minimizes the action integral (Cost × Time) while satisfying the accuracy constraint.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user perceives the agent as having "intuition" (fast answers) and "deliberation" (slow answers), mirroring human cognitive modes (System 1 vs. System 2).

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Directly implements **"Adaptive Chain-of-Thought"** (Sec. III-B) and **"Dynamic Routing"** (Sec. III-D) from the paper. It solves the "latency vs. accuracy" trade-off.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to all reasoning tasks, dialogue generation, and strategic planning within the Fun Engine.

#### The Law of Systemic Integrity-Time Adaptation (ID: `PAEA-ADAPT-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that enables `[BPMS(U)]` agents to learn and adapt *during* interaction (Systemic Integrity-Time) without requiring full model retraining.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Systemic Integrity-Time Adaptation
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `learning is continuous, not episodic`. It rejects the "Frozen Model" fallacy. The PAEA must adapt its "Soft Weights" (Prompts, Adapters, Memory) in real-time to align with the user's specific `['(ecological) niche'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Live-Wire Synapse]**

- **The Prompt Tuner (The Soft-Touch):** The system uses **In-Context Learning** and **Discrete Prompt Optimization** to adjust the "System Prompt" based on immediate feedback.
- **The Adapter Injector (The Patch):** The system utilizes **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** concepts (like LoRA-inspired memory vectors) to temporarily "patch" the model's behavior for the current session.
- **The Feedback Loop (The Correction):** User corrections ("No, do it this way") are immediately converted into "Constraint Tokens" that steer future inference.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Personalized Resonance]**

The agent feels like it "knows" the user. It stops making the same mistakes. It "settles in" to the user's specific style and requirements, creating a **Symbiotic Lock**.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Reality is relational.* The agent is not a fixed product; it is a relationship that evolves.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Plasticity):**

Follows the **Hebbian Rule of Praxial Action**: "Neurons that fire together, wire together." Successful interactions strengthen the specific "Prompt Pathways" used.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Growth." The agent seems to "get better" the more it is used, fostering a sense of investment and partnership.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Implements **"Systemic Integrity-time FM Adaptation"** (Sec. IV) and **"Prompt Tuning"** (Sec. IV-A) from the paper. Essential for "really working implementation" where users expect the system to remember preferences.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to user personalization, error correction, and long-term campaign continuity.

------

#### The Mechanism of Functional Potentiality-Aware Scheduling (ID: `PAEA-FPO-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that manages the "Cognitive Supply Chain" (Memory, Compute, Bandwidth) to prevent systemic collapse and ensure smooth operation.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Functional Potentiality-Aware Scheduling
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `cognition requires logistics`. It treats "Attention" and "Memory" as finite currencies that must be budgeted, invested, and sometimes liquidated.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Cognitive Logistics]**

- **The KV Cache Manager (The Librarian):** Implements **Dynamic KV Cache Management** (Sec. III-E). It actively "evicts" low-importance tokens from the context window (forgetting the irrelevant) to make room for new insights.
- **The Offloading Protocol (The Swap):** If the "Cognitive Load" exceeds local capacity, the system offloads non-critical tasks to "Storage" (Long-term memory) or "Cloud" (Higher-tier models), implementing **Memory Diverted Offloading**.
- **The Speculative Decoder (The Guesser):** Uses "Draft Models" (small, fast) to guess the next steps, which are then verified by the "Oracle Model" (large, slow). This speeds up "Time To First Token" (TTFT).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Sustainable Intelligence]**

The system runs indefinitely without "Out of Memory" errors or degrading into incoherence. It maintains a **Steady-State Cognitive Flow**.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Entropy is the enemy.* Efficient resource management is the fight against systemic death (crashing).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Logistics):**

Follows the **Law of Diminishing Returns**: The system stops investing functional potentiality in a task when the marginal gain in "Truth" drops below the marginal cost of "Compute."

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Reliability." The system doesn't "hang" or "crash"; it gracefully degrades or asks for time, maintaining trust.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Implements **"System Scheduling"** (Sec. III-F) and **"Dynamic KV Cache Management"** (Sec. III-E) from the paper. Critical for "embedded" or "long-context" scenarios.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to memory management, context window optimization, and multi-agent coordination.

------

#### The Directive of Symbiotic Efficiency (ID: `PAEA-SYMB-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Directive) that mandates all `[BPMS(U)]` elements to co-evolve towards mutual efficiency, creating a "Cognitive Ecosystem" rather than a collection of isolated tools.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Directive of Symbiotic Efficiency
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This directive asserts that `efficiency is a collective property`. An individual agent cannot be truly efficient if it spams other agents with noise. PAEA enforces a "Communication Protocol" that minimizes entropy and maximizes signal.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Signal-to-Noise Filter]**

- **The Compression Handshake:** When Agent A talks to Agent B, PAEA compresses the message into "Atomic Facts" or "Gist Tokens" (Sec. III-A4). No verbose prose is exchanged between machines.
- **The Shared Knowledge Graph:** Instead of each agent storing its own copy of the world, they share a central **"Semantic Memory"** (Sec. IV-C). This reduces redundancy (deduplication).
- **The Collaborative Tuning:** Feedback from one agent (e.g., "This plan failed") is used to tune the prompts of *all* relevant agents, implementing **Distributed Test-Time Adaptation**.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Hive-Mind Coherence]**

The system acts as a unified organism. The "Left Hand" (Creative Agent) knows what the "Right Hand" (Critic Agent) is doing without needing a full meeting.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Unity is strength.* A fragmented system is a weak system.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Symbiosis):**

Follows the **Nash Equilibrium of Cooperation**: The optimal strategy for each agent is to minimize its own functional potentiality consumption while maximizing the utility provided to the network.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Harmony." The different tools and agents feel like they are "on the same page," anticipating needs and sharing context seamlessly.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Implements **"Multi-agent cooperation"** and **"Distributed info-sharing"** (Sec. II-B) from the paper. Essential for the "Fun Engine" which is a multi-module framework.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to inter-module communication, shared memory systems, and multi-agent workflows.

------

#### The Protocol of Mnemonic Compression (ID: `PAEA-MEM-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that defines how the PAEA compresses "Experience" into "Wisdom" to save space and improve retrieval, ensuring long-term existence.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Mnemonic Compression
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `memory is reconstruction, not recording`. To remember everything is to drown. PAEA actively compresses raw logs into "Semantic Kernels" that can be "rehydrated" into full memories when needed.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Gist-Encoder]**

- **The Gisting Process:** Uses **"Gisting"** (Sec. III-A4) to compress long instructions or histories into compact "Gist Tokens" that retain the *functional* instruction without the *lexical* weight.
- **The Semantic Indexing:** Memories are stored not by timestamp, but by **"Embedding Vector"** (Meaning). This allows for **"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)"** that is "Sparse" (efficient) yet "Dense" (meaningful).
- **The Forgetting Curve:** Implements a "Decay Function." Unaccessed memories are progressively compressed further until they become mere "Traces" or are archived to "Cold Storage."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Deep Time Continuity]**

The agent can maintain a "Persona" or "Campaign State" over months or years of interaction without hitting context limits. It has a "History."

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Wisdom is subtraction.* Knowing what to ignore is as important as knowing what to keep.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Compression):**

Follows **Shannon's Source Coding Theorem**: The system encodes the message to the minimum number of bits required to reconstruct the *meaning* (semantics), not the *signal* (syntax).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Recall." The agent brings up relevant past details ("Like we discussed last month...") without being prompted, creating a sense of shared history.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Implements **"Task Definition Optimization"** (Gisting) and **"Memory-augmented adaptation"** (Sec. IV-C) from the paper.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to long-term memory, history logs, and save-game states.
