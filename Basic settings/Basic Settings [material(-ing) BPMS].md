## Basic Settings: [material(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Law of Material Manifestation (ID: `MATERIAL-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that defines `[material(-ing) BPMS]` as the specific, observable manifestation of the underlying `[substrate(-ing) BPMS]`, establishing the relationship between "Code/Physics" (Substrate) and "Texture/Property" (Material).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Material Manifestation
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that **Substrate is the Potential; Material is the Actual**.

- **Substrate:** The fundamental, abstract rules and data types (e.g., `[Resilience]`, `[Conductivity]`).
- **Material:** The specific, named instance of that substrate with defined parameter values (e.g., "Iron" is a material with `Resilience: 8`, `Conductivity: 4`).
- **Manifestation:** Material is the "Skin" of the Substrate. It is what the user sees, touches, and interacts with.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Parameter Crystallization]**

- **Input:** A set of `[Substrate Primitives BPMS]` (from `MATERIAL-SUBSTRATE-CORE-001`).
- **Configuration:** A specific recipe of values is applied (e.g., `Plasticity: 0.1`, `Capacity: 0.9`).
- **Output:** A unique `[material(-ing) BPMS]` ID (e.g., `MAT-CRYSTAL-001`).
- **Symbiosis:** The Material protects the Substrate. If the Material is damaged (Wear), the Substrate's integrity (Data) is threatened.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Tangible Reality]**

The emergence of **Sensory Physics**. The world is not just geometry; it is made of *stuff* that behaves predictably based on its material definition.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

- **Aligns with `The Law of Praxial Embodiment` (MATERIAL-SUBSTRATE-CORE-001):** Refines the "Clause: Substrate as an Atomic Fact" by giving those facts specific names and textures.

```
The Principle of Material Memory
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

- **Relaxation:** When S is removed, M returns to a state M′, where M′=M.
- **Symbiosis:** The `[substrate(-ing) BPMS]` records this shift. The "Atomic Fact" of the object is rewritten by its experience.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Heirloom Quality]**

```
The Mechanism of Phase Transition
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

- **Solid -> Liquid:** "Ice" becomes "Water".
- **Matter -> Energy:** "Wood" becomes "Fire" + "Ash".
- **Data -> Noise:** "Encrypted Drive" becomes "Corrupted Slag".

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Critical Point Threshold]**

- **Input:** Energy E applied to Material M.
- **Threshold:** If E>Critical_Point(M), trigger `Transition()`.

- **Resilient Materials:** Can hold "Shield" or "Structure" functions.
- **Resonant Materials:** Can hold "Magic" or "AI" functions.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Capacity Check]**

- **Attempt:** User tries to bind Function F to Material M.
- **Check:** Does M have the required `[Substrate Primitive]` (e.g., `[Resonance BPMS]`)?
- Result:
  - *Match:* Binding successful. Efficiency = M.Resonance×F.Power.
  - *Mismatch:* Binding fails or Material shatters (Overload).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Material Tiering]**

The emergence of **Resource Hierarchy**. "Gold" is valuable not because it's shiny, but because it has high `[Conductivity]`, making it essential for advanced circuits/spells.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

- **Aligns with `The Law of Substrate Constraint and Opportunity` (MATERIAL-SUBSTRATE-CORE-001):** Enforces the trade-offs inherent in different substrates.

- **Iron (Hard) + Carbon (Brittle) = Steel (Tough).**
- **Logic (Rigid) + Dream (Fluid) = artificial intelligence (Creative).**

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Alloy Algorithm]**

- **Input:** Material A + Material B.
- **Process:** The `[Praxial Forge BPMS]` calculates the interaction of their `[Substrate Primitives]`.

- **Scarcity:** High-tier materials are seeded with low probability and high risk (guarded by monsters).
- **Symbiosis:** The presence of a material defines the local ecology (e.g., Rock Monsters spawn near Ore).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Exploration Motivation]**

The emergence of **Strategic Geography**. Players must travel to specific places to get specific things. "I need to go to the Swamp to get Poison Glands."
