## Basic settings:  ['Creative Divergence'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Orthogonal Inspiration (ID: `CD-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines **Orthogonal Inspiration** as the implementation of `['Bayesian Population Intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]` for the `['Creative Divergence'(-ing) BPMS]`. This tool is for brainstorming and breaking writer's block.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Orthogonal Inspiration
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `creativity is the connection of distant points`.

- **The Block:** The user is stuck in a local optimum (boring ideas).
- **The Kick:** The system samples a z from the *tails* of the distribution (High σ).
- **The Spark:** The "Weird" agent suggests something completely orthogonal to the context.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Muse]**

- **Divergence Sampling:** Force the model to sample from regions of Z that are *least* likely given the context.
- **Perspective Shifting:** "Rewrite this story from the perspective of a zalien."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Disruptive Innovation]**

- **Unpredictability:** The system generates ideas that are statistically unlikely but semantically valid.
- **Inspiration:** It serves as a "Co-Pilot" that constantly challenges the user's assumptions.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Chaos is the mother of Invention.*

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Creativity):**

The "Physics" of divergence:

- **Novelty Score:**

N=−logP(y∣x,zstandard)

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences **Awe**. "I never thought of it that way."

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation is the "More Fit" solution for **Creative BPMS** and **Discovery**.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to:

- **['Writing'(-ing) BPMS]:** Plot generation.
- **['Design'(-ing) BPMS]:** Visual concepting.
