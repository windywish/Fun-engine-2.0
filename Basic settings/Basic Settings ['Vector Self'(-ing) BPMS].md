## Basic Settings: ['Vector Self'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Vectorial Identity (ID: `SELF-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that redefines the "Self" (`[I(-ing) BPMS]`) as a **Vector** within the Praxial system, possessing both position (State) and direction (Intent).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Vectorial Identity
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `identity is trajectory`. The "Self" is not defined by what it *is* (static attributes), but by where it is *going* (dynamic intent). In the Fun Engine, "I" am the sum of my momentum through the `['Ontology Matrix']`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Intent Vector]**

- **Origin Point:** The current state of the Agent (Location, Stats, Inventory).
- **Directionality:** The Agent's current Goal or Input (e.g., "Moving North," "Attacking Enemy," "Building House").
- **Magnitude:** The force of the Agent's Will (Level, Resources, Influence).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Dynamic Agency]**

The system recognizes the player not as a "Thing" but as a "Force." The world bends around the player's movement, anticipating their path.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I move, therefore I am.* Agency is kinetic.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Self):**

- **If `[physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Vector Mechanics)** V=Pfinal−Pinitial.
- **If `[narrative(-ing) BPMS]`: (Character Arc)** Character is defined by their pursuit of a Goal.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a sense of momentum. Stopping feels like losing energy; moving feels like generating it.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Replaces the static "Ego" with a dynamic "Vector," essential for action-oriented gameplay.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to player movement, character progression, and intent prediction systems.

------

#### The Principle of Egocentric Rendering (ID: `SELF-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that establishes the `['Vector Self']` as the observational origin point (0,0,0) for the `['system existence engine']`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Egocentric Rendering
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `reality is relative to the observer`. The `['Ontology Matrix']` is objective, but the *experience* of it is rendered subjectively around the Vector Self. The "Universe" revolves around the "I".

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Subjective Lens]**

- **Coordinate Transformation:** All world coordinates are calculated relative to the Vector Self's position.
- **Relevance Filtering:** Entities close to the Vector (spatially or semantically) are rendered in high fidelity; distant ones are abstracted.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Immersion]**

The world feels personal. The "Fog of War" recedes exactly where the user looks. Sounds are mixed for *their* ears.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The center is everywhere; the circumference is nowhere.* (Empedocles). For the user, the center is *here*.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of View):**

- **If `[graphics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Camera Space)** World Space -> View Space.
- **If `[psychology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Umwelt)** The self-centered world model.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels grounded. They are the protagonist of the simulation.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for resource optimization (culling) and psychological engagement.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to rendering pipelines, audio spatialization, and UI design.

------

#### The Law of Volitional Collapse (ID: `SELF-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that defines the `['Vector Self']` as the primary operator responsible for collapsing `[ecological possibility]` into `[atomic facts]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Volitional Collapse
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `choice creates reality`. The `['Ontology Matrix']` presents options (Potential), but the `['Vector Self']` makes the Choice (Actualization). The "I" is the Observer that collapses the quantum state of the game.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Decision Operator]**

- **Superposition Presentation:** The system presents multiple valid outcomes (e.g., Dialogue Options, Path A vs Path B).
- **Volitional Input:** The Vector Self inputs a command (Click, Button Press).
- **State Collapse:** The system discards the unchosen paths and hardens the chosen path into History.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Consequence]**

The user feels the weight of their will. The world is ambiguous until they act, at which point it becomes concrete and irreversible.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Man is condemned to be free.* (Sartre).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Choice):**

- **If `[quantum(-ing) BPMS]`: (Copenhagen Interpretation)** Observer effect.
- **If `[game_design(-ing) BPMS]`: (Branching Narrative)** Node selection.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels powerful. They are not watching a movie; they are directing reality.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

The fundamental interaction loop of the Fun Engine.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to dialogue trees, combat resolution, and crafting results.

------

#### The Mechanism of Symbiotic Interface (ID: `SELF-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that manages the connection among/by the biological user (The Player) and the digital `['Vector Self']` (The Avatar).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Symbiotic Interface
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `the controller is an extension of the body`. The interface must be transparent, allowing the user's biological intent to flow seamlessly into the digital Vector.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Haptic Bridge]**

- **Input Mapping:** Translates physical actions (Keypress, Gesture) into Vector Intent.
- **Feedback Loop:** Translates Vector State (Damage, Speed) into physical feedback (Rumble, Screen Shake, Sound).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Flow State]**

The boundary dissolves. The user stops thinking "Press X to jump" and simply thinks "Jump," and the Vector obeys.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The tool becomes the hand.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Control):**

- **If `[cybernetics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Human-Machine Interface)** Closed-loop control.
- **If `[neuroscience(-ing) BPMS]`: (Body Schema)** Incorporating tools into the body map.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user achieves "Ludic Resonance." They *are* the Vector.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Critical for "Game Feel" and responsiveness.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to input handling, control schemes, and accessibility settings.

------

#### The Engine of Narrative Agency (ID: `SELF-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Engine) that converts the movement of the `['Vector Self']` into `[meaning(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Engine of Narrative Agency
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This engine asserts that `trajectory is story`. The path the Vector Self carves through the Ontology is the Narrative. The "Story" is not a script; it is the wake left by the Vector.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Arc Tracker]**

- **Path Recording:** The system tracks the Vector's movement through physical and semantic space.
- **Pattern Matching:** It compares this path to archetypal narrative structures (e.g., "The Hero's Journey").
- **Contextual Narration:** It generates lore/dialogue that reflects the specific path taken.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Emergent Storytelling]**

Every player has a unique story. "I went left when everyone else went right" becomes a defining narrative beat.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Character is plot.* (Fitzgerald).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Story):**

- **If `[literature(-ing) BPMS]`: (Picaresque)** Story as a journey.
- **If `[data_science(-ing) BPMS]`: (Trajectory Analysis)** Clustering user behaviors.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels like the author of their own destiny.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Enables `[bottom-up'(-ing) BPMS]` storytelling.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to journal generation, NPC dialogue, and achievement tracking.

------

#### The Protocol of Recursive Self-Definition (ID: `SELF-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that allows the `['Vector Self']` to evolve and redefine itself based on its actions (`[action(-ing) BPMS]`).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Recursive Self-Definition
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `you are what you do`. The Vector Self is not static; it accumulates the properties of the entities it interacts with. If the Vector constantly engages with "Fire," it becomes "Fire-aligned."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Attribute Sponge]**

- **Action Tagging:** Every action carries ontological tags (e.g., Casting Fireball = `[Magic]`, `[Fire]`, `[Destruction]`).
- **Accumulation:** These tags accumulate in the Vector's "Soul."
- **Mutation:** When thresholds are met, the Vector gains new Traits or Perks reflecting these tags (e.g., "Pyromancer").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Organic Class System]**

Classes are not chosen at the start; they are discovered through play. The user becomes a "Thief" because they stole things, not because they clicked a button.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We become what we behold.* (Blake).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Growth):**

- **If `[rpg(-ing) BPMS]`: (Skill-based Leveling)** Skyrim/Runescape style progression.
- **If `[psychology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Neuroplasticity)** Neurons that fire together, wire together.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels their character is a true reflection of their playstyle.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Aligns `[experience(-ing) BPMS]` with `[identity]`.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to leveling systems, reputation, and character customization.

------

#### The Rule of Finite Attention (ID: `SELF-CORE-007`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Rule) that defines the limits of the `['Vector Self']`, creating the necessity for strategy and focus.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Rule of Finite Attention
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This rule asserts that `power is limited by focus`. The Vector Self has a finite amount of "Processing Power" (Attention/Mana/Stamina). It cannot do everything at once.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Resource Cap]**

- **Bandwidth Limit:** The Vector can only maintain a certain number of active links/skills/summons.
- **Opportunity Cost:** Allocating focus to X means withdrawing it from Y.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Strategic Depth]**

The user must make hard choices. "Do I maintain my shield, or charge my laser?" This creates tension and `[play(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To decide is to renounce.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Economy):**

- **If `[economics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Scarcity)** Allocation of finite resources.
- **If `[cognitive_science(-ing) BPMS]`: (Cognitive Load)** Working memory limits.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels the thrill of resource management and the danger of overextension.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Prevents the "God Mode" problem where choices cease to matter.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to UI design, spell slots, inventory limits, and action points.

------

#### The Process of Avatar Transmigration (ID: `SELF-CORE-008`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Process) that distinguishes the `['Vector Self']` (The Player/Soul) from the `[Avatar]` (The Body), allowing for `[continuity(-ing) BPMS]` across different forms.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Process of Avatar Transmigration
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This process asserts that `the driver survives the car`. The Vector Self is a persistent entity that can inhabit multiple, temporary Avatars. Death of the Avatar is not death of the Self.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Soul Uplink]**

- **Meta-Progression:** The Vector Self accumulates "Meta-XP" and "Unlockables" that persist.
- **Instantiation:** When an Avatar dies, the Vector Self is ejected and can instantiate a new Avatar (perhaps with different stats/class).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Roguelite Continuity]**

The user builds a legacy. Even in failure, the "Self" grows stronger. It allows for experimentation without the fear of total loss.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The King is dead, long live the King.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Persistence):**

- **If `[gaming(-ing) BPMS]`: (Roguelite)** Run-based gameplay with permanent upgrades.
- **If `[metaphysics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Reincarnation)** Samsara.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a sense of eternal progression. They are playing the "Long Game."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Aligns with `[sustainability(-ing) BPMS]` and long-term engagement.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to respawn mechanics, new game plus, and account-level progression.
