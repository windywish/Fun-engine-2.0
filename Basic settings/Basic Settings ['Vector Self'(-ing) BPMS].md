## Basic Settings: ['Vector Self'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Vectorial Identity (ID: `SELF-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that redefines the "Self" (`[I(-ing) BPMS]`) as a **Vector** within the Praxial system, possessing both position (State) and direction (Intent).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Vectorial Identity
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `identity is trajectory`. The "Self" is not defined by what it *is* (static attributes), but by where it is *going* (dynamic intent). In the Fun Engine, "I" am the sum of my momentum through the `['Ontology Matrix']`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Intent Vector]**

- **Origin Point:** The current state of the Agent (Location, Stats, Inventory).
- **Directionality:** The Agent's current Goal or Input (e.g., "Moving North," "Attacking Enemy," "Building House").
- **Magnitude:** The force of the Agent's Will (Level, Resources, Influence).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Dynamic Agency]**

The system recognizes the player not as a "Thing" but as a "Force." The world bends around the player's movement, anticipating their path.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I move, therefore I am.* Agency is kinetic.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Self):**

- **If `[physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Vector Mechanics)** V=Pfinal−Pinitial.
- **If `[narrative(-ing) BPMS]`: (Character Arc)** Character is defined by their pursuit of a Goal.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a sense of momentum. Stopping feels like losing energy; moving feels like generating it.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Replaces the static "Ego" with a dynamic "Vector," essential for action-oriented gameplay.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to player movement, character progression, and intent prediction systems.

------

#### The Principle of Egocentric Rendering (ID: `SELF-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that establishes the `['Vector Self']` as the observational origin point (0,0,0) for the `['system existence engine']`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Egocentric Rendering
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `reality is relative to the observer`. The `['Ontology Matrix']` is objective, but the *experience* of it is rendered subjectively around the Vector Self. The "Universe" revolves around the "I".

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Subjective Lens]**

- **Coordinate Transformation:** All world coordinates are calculated relative to the Vector Self's position.
- **Relevance Filtering:** Entities close to the Vector (spatially or semantically) are rendered in high fidelity; distant ones are abstracted.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Immersion]**

The world feels personal. The "Fog of War" recedes exactly where the user looks. Sounds are mixed for *their* ears.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The center is everywhere; the circumference is nowhere.* (Empedocles). For the user, the center is *here*.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of View):**

- **If `[graphics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Camera Space)** World Space -> View Space.
- **If `[psychology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Umwelt)** The self-centered world model.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels grounded. They are the protagonist of the simulation.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for resource optimization (culling) and psychological engagement.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to rendering pipelines, audio spatialization, and UI design.

------

#### The Law of Volitional Collapse (ID: `SELF-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that defines the `['Vector Self']` as the primary operator responsible for collapsing `[ecological possibility]` into `[atomic facts]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Volitional Collapse
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `choice creates reality`. The `['Ontology Matrix']` presents options (Potential), but the `['Vector Self']` makes the Choice (Actualization). The "I" is the Observer that collapses the quantum state of the game.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Decision Operator]**

- **Superposition Presentation:** The system presents multiple valid outcomes (e.g., Dialogue Options, Path A vs Path B).
- **Volitional Input:** The Vector Self inputs a command (Click, Button Press).
- **State Collapse:** The system discards the unchosen paths and hardens the chosen path into History.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Consequence]**

The user feels the weight of their will. The world is ambiguous until they act, at which point it becomes concrete and irreversible.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Man is condemned to be free.* (Sartre).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Choice):**

- **If `[quantum(-ing) BPMS]`: (Copenhagen Interpretation)** Observer effect.
- **If `[game_design(-ing) BPMS]`: (Branching Narrative)** Node selection.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels powerful. They are not watching a movie; they are directing reality.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

The fundamental interaction loop of the Fun Engine.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to dialogue trees, combat resolution, and crafting results.

------

#### The Mechanism of Symbiotic Interface (ID: `SELF-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that manages the connection among/by the biological user (The Player) and the digital `['Vector Self']` (The Avatar).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Symbiotic Interface
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `the controller is an extension of the body`. The interface must be transparent, allowing the user's biological intent to flow seamlessly into the digital Vector.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Haptic Bridge]**

- **Input Mapping:** Translates physical actions (Keypress, Gesture) into Vector Intent.
- **Feedback Loop:** Translates Vector State (Damage, Speed) into physical feedback (Rumble, Screen Shake, Sound).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Flow State]**

The boundary dissolves. The user stops thinking "Press X to jump" and simply thinks "Jump," and the Vector obeys.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The tool becomes the hand.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Control):**

- **If `[cybernetics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Human-Machine Interface)** Closed-loop control.
- **If `[neuroscience(-ing) BPMS]`: (Body Schema)** Incorporating tools into the body map.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user achieves "Ludic Resonance." They *are* the Vector.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Critical for "Game Feel" and responsiveness.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to input handling, control schemes, and accessibility settings.

------

#### The Engine of Narrative Agency (ID: `SELF-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Engine) that converts the movement of the `['Vector Self']` into `[meaning(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Engine of Narrative Agency
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This engine asserts that `trajectory is story`. The path the Vector Self carves through the Ontology is the Narrative. The "Story" is not a script; it is the wake left by the Vector.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Arc Tracker]**

- **Path Recording:** The system tracks the Vector's movement through physical and semantic space.
- **Pattern Matching:** It compares this path to archetypal narrative structures (e.g., "The Hero's Journey").
- **Contextual Narration:** It generates lore/dialogue that reflects the specific path taken.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Emergent Storytelling]**

Every player has a unique story. "I went left when everyone else went right" becomes a defining narrative beat.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Character is plot.* (Fitzgerald).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Story):**

- **If `[literature(-ing) BPMS]`: (Picaresque)** Story as a journey.
- **If `[data_science(-ing) BPMS]`: (Trajectory Analysis)** Clustering user behaviors.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels like the author of their own destiny.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Enables `[bottom-up'(-ing) BPMS]` storytelling.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to journal generation, NPC dialogue, and achievement tracking.

------

#### The Protocol of Recursive Self-Definition (ID: `SELF-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that allows the `['Vector Self']` to evolve and redefine itself based on its actions (`[action(-ing) BPMS]`).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Recursive Self-Definition
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `you are what you do`. The Vector Self is not static; it accumulates the properties of the entities it interacts with. If the Vector constantly engages with "Fire," it becomes "Fire-aligned."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Attribute Sponge]**

- **Action Tagging:** Every action carries ontological tags (e.g., Casting Fireball = `[Magic]`, `[Fire]`, `[Destruction]`).
- **Accumulation:** These tags accumulate in the Vector's "Soul."
- **Mutation:** When thresholds are met, the Vector gains new Traits or Perks reflecting these tags (e.g., "Pyromancer").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Organic Class System]**

Classes are not chosen at the start; they are discovered through play. The user becomes a "Thief" because they stole things, not because they clicked a button.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We become what we behold.* (Blake).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Growth):**

- **If `[rpg(-ing) BPMS]`: (Skill-based Leveling)** Skyrim/Runescape style progression.
- **If `[psychology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Neuroplasticity)** Neurons that fire together, wire together.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels their character is a true reflection of their playstyle.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Aligns `[experience(-ing) BPMS]` with `[identity]`.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to leveling systems, reputation, and character customization.

------

#### The Rule of Finite Attention (ID: `SELF-CORE-007`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Rule) that defines the limits of the `['Vector Self']`, creating the necessity for strategy and focus.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Rule of Finite Attention
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This rule asserts that `power is limited by focus`. The Vector Self has a finite amount of "Processing Power" (Attention/Mana/Stamina). It cannot do everything at once.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Resource Cap]**

- **Bandwidth Limit:** The Vector can only maintain a certain number of active links/skills/summons.
- **Opportunity Cost:** Allocating focus to X means withdrawing it from Y.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Strategic Depth]**

The user must make hard choices. "Do I maintain my shield, or charge my laser?" This creates tension and `[play(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To decide is to renounce.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Economy):**

- **If `[economics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Scarcity)** Allocation of finite resources.
- **If `[cognitive_science(-ing) BPMS]`: (Cognitive Load)** Working memory limits.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels the thrill of resource management and the danger of overextension.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Prevents the "God Mode" problem where choices cease to matter.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to UI design, spell slots, inventory limits, and action points.

------

#### The Process of Avatar Transmigration (ID: `SELF-CORE-008`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Process) that distinguishes the `['Vector Self']` (The Player/Soul) from the `[Avatar]` (The Body), allowing for `[continuity(-ing) BPMS]` across different forms.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Process of Avatar Transmigration
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This process asserts that `the driver survives the car`. The Vector Self is a persistent entity that can inhabit multiple, temporary Avatars. Death of the Avatar is not death of the Self.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Soul Uplink]**

- **Meta-Progression:** The Vector Self accumulates "Meta-XP" and "Unlockables" that persist.
- **Instantiation:** When an Avatar dies, the Vector Self is ejected and can instantiate a new Avatar (perhaps with different stats/class).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Roguelite Continuity]**

The user builds a legacy. Even in failure, the "Self" grows stronger. It allows for experimentation without the fear of total loss.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The King is dead, long live the King.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Persistence):**

- **If `[gaming(-ing) BPMS]`: (Roguelite)** Run-based gameplay with permanent upgrades.
- **If `[metaphysics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Reincarnation)** Samsara.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a sense of eternal progression. They are playing the "Long Game."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Aligns with `[sustainability(-ing) BPMS]` and long-term engagement.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to respawn mechanics, new game plus, and account-level progression.

---

#### The Axiom of Creative Projection (ID: `SELF-CORE-009`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the `['Vector Self']` as a source of `[creative(-ing) BPMS]` energy, capable of projecting new `[ecological possibility]` onto the `['Ontology Matrix']`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Creative Projection
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `imagination is input`. The Vector Self does not just select from existing options; it can project new options. By combining existing `[atomic facts]` in novel ways (`[innovative(-ing) BPMS]`), the user creates new realities.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Synthesis Engine]**

- **Input Combination:** The user combines Entity A + Entity B + Intent Vector.
- **Possibility Check:** The system calculates if this combination creates a valid new `[ecological niche]`.
- **Instantiation:** If valid, a new Entity is born (e.g., Stick + Rock + "Hit" = Hammer).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Maker Culture]**

The user feels like an inventor. The world is a box of Lego bricks, not a pre-painted diorama.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To create is to divine.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Creation):**

- **If `[crafting(-ing) BPMS]`: (Combinatorics)** Recipe discovery.
- **If `[language(-ing) BPMS]`: (Neologism)** Coining new terms.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences the joy of `[initiative(-ing) BPMS]`. They are not just following a script.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for `[open(-ing) BPMS]` gameplay and sandbox environments.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to crafting, spell creation, and base building.

------

#### The Principle of Bottom-Up Authority (ID: `SELF-CORE-010`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that grants the `['Vector Self']` the authority to drive `['bottom-up'(-ing) BPMS]` changes in the `['metasystem engine'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Bottom-Up Authority
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `authority flows from action`. The rules of the world (`[metasystem]`) are not absolute; they can be rewritten by the collective `[action(-ing) BPMS]` of the Vector Selves.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Consensus Protocol]**

- **Behavior Tracking:** The system monitors the aggregate behavior of all Vector Selves.
- **Rule Drift:** If a critical mass of Vectors ignores a rule (e.g., "Don't walk on the grass"), the rule is deprecated.
- **New Norms:** If Vectors consistently perform a new action (e.g., "Using chairs as ladders"), it becomes a supported mechanic.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Democratic Reality]**

The community shapes the physics/laws of the world. It is `[constructive(-ing) BPMS]` anarchy.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Vox Populi, Vox Dei.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Governance):**

- **If `[sociology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Social Contract)** Legitimacy comes from the governed.
- **If `[linguistics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Descriptivism)** Usage defines meaning.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels their culture matters.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Aligns with `[world building BPMS]` at a societal level.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to MMO server rules, economy balancing, and meta-game evolution.

------

#### The Law of Disruptive Value Generation (ID: `SELF-CORE-011`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that rewards `[disruptive(-ing) BPMS]` behavior when it generates new `[value(-ing) BPMS]` or `[utility(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Disruptive Value Generation
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `value requires disruption`. To create a new `[ecological niche]`, the Vector Self must often destroy or obsolete an old one. The system incentivizes this "Creative Destruction."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Innovation Bonus]**

- **Stagnation Penalty:** Doing the same thing repeatedly yields diminishing returns (Boredom/Inflation).
- **Disruption Reward:** Breaking a pattern to achieve a higher `[utility(-ing) BPMS]` yields a massive "Innovation Bonus" (XP, Resources, Fame).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Dynamic Economy]**

The world never settles into a solved state. Players are constantly looking for the "Next Big Thing."

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Progress):**

- **If `[economics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Schumpeterian Growth)** Innovation drives growth.
- **If `[evolution(-ing) BPMS]`: (Punctuated Equilibrium)** Rapid change after stasis.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels the thrill of being a revolutionary or a pioneer.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Keeps the `[system existence engine]` fresh and engaging.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to combat meta, market speculation, and speedrunning.

------

#### The Mechanism of Essential Resonance (ID: `SELF-CORE-012`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that aligns the `[essence(-ing) BPMS]` of the Vector Self with the `[essence(-ing) BPMS]` of the world, creating `[meaning(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Essential Resonance
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `like attracts like`. When the Vector Self acts in accordance with its defined Essence (e.g., a "Paladin" acting "Honorably"), it resonates with the `['praxial substrate']`, amplifying its power.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Resonance Multiplier]**

- **Essence Matching:** The system compares the Action Tags with the Self Tags.
- **Amplification:** High alignment (Resonance) boosts the magnitude of the Intent Vector (Critical Hits, Social Success).
- **Dissonance:** Low alignment (Hypocrisy) dampens the effect.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Roleplay Integrity]**

The mechanics reinforce the narrative. Playing "in character" is optimal strategy.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To thine own self be true.* (Shakespeare).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Magic):**

- **If `[magic(-ing) BPMS]`: (Sympathetic Magic)** Connection strengthens power.
- **If `[psychology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Cognitive Dissonance)** Alignment reduces stress.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a deep sense of `[coherent(-ing) BPMS]` identity.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Bridges the gap among/by "Roleplaying" and "Roll-playing."

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to class abilities, dialogue checks, and reputation.

------

#### The Engine of Holonic Integration (ID: `SELF-CORE-013`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Engine) that allows the `['Vector Self']` to merge with others to form `['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]` and access `['super intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Engine of Holonic Integration
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This engine asserts that `I am We`. The Vector Self is not isolated; it can link with other Vectors (Players or artificial intelligende) to form a higher-order Entity (a "Party," "Guild," or "Gestalt").

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Mind Meld]**

- **Vector Summation:** The Intent Vectors of the group are summed.
- **Emergent Capabilities:** The Holon gains abilities that no individual possesses (e.g., "Raid Buffs," "Hive Mind Vision").
- **Distributed Cognition:** Processing tasks are shared across the nodes.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Collective Effervescence]**

The user feels the power of belonging to something greater than themselves.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Groups):**

- **If `[biology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Superorganism)** Ant colony / Beehive.
- **If `[computing(-ing) BPMS]`: (Cluster Computing)** Parallel processing.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences `[(symbiois) evolution]` firsthand.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for multiplayer dynamics and squad-based gameplay.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to party systems, guild mechanics, and co-op combos.

------

#### The Protocol of Praxial Cognition (ID: `SELF-CORE-014`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that defines how the `['Vector Self']` perceives and processes the `['praxial substrate'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Praxial Cognition
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `perception is active`. `['praxial cognition'(-ing) BPMS]` is not just receiving data; it is querying the substrate. The Vector Self "pings" the world to understand it.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Active Scan]**

- **Query Projection:** The Vector projects a "Question" (e.g., "Is this wall breakable?").
- **Substrate Response:** The Substrate returns an "Answer" (Atomic Fact: `Breakable=True`).
- **Cognitive Rendering:** The answer is rendered as a visual cue (Cracked texture).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Investigative Depth]**

The world reveals itself only to those who ask the right questions.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Seek and ye shall find.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Perception):**

- **If `[cognitive_science(-ing) BPMS]`: (Active Inference)** Brain predicts and samples.
- **If `[radar(-ing) BPMS]`: (Echolocation)** Ping -> Return.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels engaged and observant.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Aligns `[atomic facts]` with user attention.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to detective mode, scanning mechanics, and UI tooltips.

------

#### The Law of Continuity in Change (ID: `SELF-CORE-015`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that ensures `[continuity(-ing) BPMS]` of the Self even during radical `[(symbiois) evolution]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Continuity in Change
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `evolution preserves the core`. Even as the Vector Self mutates, upgrades, or changes form (e.g., turning into a dragon), the underlying "Stream of Consciousness" (The Vector ID) remains `[coherent(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Thread of Theseus]**

- **Incremental Update:** Changes happen sequentially, not instantly replacing the whole.
- **Memory Persistence:** The `[Long-Term Memory]` of the Self is invariant across forms.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Stable Identity]**

The user can undergo massive transformations without feeling a loss of self. "I am still me, even if I am now a robot."

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I change, but I remain.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Identity):**

- **If `[philosophy(-ing) BPMS]`: (Psychological Continuity)** Lockean memory theory.
- **If `[coding(-ing) BPMS]`: (UUID)** Unique Identifier persists.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a continuous narrative arc.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for `[transhumanist(-ing) BPMS]` themes and shapeshifting mechanics.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to polymorph spells, cybernetic upgrades, and prestige systems.

------

#### The Process of Symbiotic World-Building (ID: `SELF-CORE-016`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Process) that enables the `['Vector Self']` to engage in `[world building BPMS]` through `[(symbiois) evolution]` with the environment.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Process of Symbiotic World-Building
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This process asserts that `building is a conversation`. The user does not just impose their will on the world; they negotiate with it. The terrain suggests a castle; the user builds it; the castle changes the terrain.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Co-Creation Loop]**

- **Affordance Offer:** The environment offers `[ecological possibility]` (e.g., "This hill is defensible").
- **Vector Action:** The user acts on this offer (Builds Wall).
- **System Response:** The system evolves the environment (Trees grow around the wall, animals nest in it).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Organic Architecture]**

The world feels lived-in and natural. Structures blend with the landscape.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Art imitates nature.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Design):**

- **If `[architecture(-ing) BPMS]`: (Pattern Language)** Alexander's living structures.
- **If `[ecology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Succession)** Ecosystem development.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels like a steward of the land, not just a conqueror.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

The ultimate expression of `[constructive(-ing) BPMS]` play.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to settlement building, terraforming, and gardening systems.

#### The Mechanism of Mnestic Integration (ID: `SELF-CORE-017`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that governs the `[(symbiois) evolution]` amomg/by the Vector Self's `['short-term (memory)'(-ing) BPMS]` (Immediate Context) and `['long-term (memory)'(-ing) BPMS]` (Identity/Lore).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Mnestic Integration
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `action becomes identity`. The Vector Self's short-term actions (e.g., "I saved this specific wolf") are filtered. Significant actions are integrated into the Long-Term Memory, permanently altering the Self's identity (e.g., gaining the "Wolf-Friend" trait).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Narrative Buffer]**

- **Buffer Input:** All immediate actions enter the Short-Term Buffer.
- **Significance Filter:** The system evaluates actions based on emotional impact, difficulty, and repetition.
- **Integration:** High-significance actions are written to the Long-Term Core, modifying the Vector's "History" and "Reputation."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Living Biography]**

The user's character is not defined by a backstory written at creation, but by the accumulated history of their actual gameplay.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We are what we repeatedly do.* (Aristotle).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Memory):**

- **If `[neuroscience(-ing) BPMS]`: (Consolidation)** Hippocampus to Neocortex transfer.
- **If `[rpg(-ing) BPMS]`: (Quest Log)** Active Objectives -> Completed Journal.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels that their past actions matter and define who they are today.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Ensures `[continuity(-ing) BPMS]` of character development.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

#### The Axiom of Subjective Actualization (ID: `SELF-CORE-018`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the `[(symbiois) evolution]` among/by the Vector Self's `[reality(-ing) BPMS]` (Perceived World) and the system's `['truth'(-ing) BPMS]` (Objective Data).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Subjective Actualization
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `perception influences truth`. If the Vector Self perceives a "Secret Door" (due to high Insight stats) where the objective Truth says there is a "Wall," the system may evolve the Truth to match the Reality, spawning the door.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Observation Collapse]**

- **Perception Check:** The Vector Self queries the environment.
- **Data Mutation:** If the Vector's "Belief/Insight" is strong enough, it can overwrite the default state of the object.
- **Synchronization:** The System updates the `['truth'(-ing) BPMS]` to align with the new `[reality(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Magical Realism]**

The world changes based on what the user is capable of seeing. A wizard sees mana lines; a thief sees escape routes.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Believing is seeing.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Truth):**

- **If `[quantum_mechanics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Observer Effect)** Measurement determines state.
- **If `[game_design(-ing) BPMS]`: (Client-Side Prediction)** Client reality overrides server lag.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels their perspective has power.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Empowers `[praxial cognition'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to hidden object mechanics, illusion magic, and sanity systems.

#### The Engine of Vector-Matrix Coupling (ID: `SELF-CORE-019`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Engine) that drives the `[(symbiois) evolution]` among/by the `['system vector'(-ing) BPMS]` (The Player) and the `['system matrix'(-ing) BPMS]` (The Environment).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Engine of Vector-Matrix Coupling
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This engine asserts that `force meets resistance`. The Vector Self applies force (Action) to the Matrix. The Matrix applies resistance (Challenge) to the Vector. This friction generates "Heat" (Fun/Drama).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Dynamic Difficulty Loop]**

- **Vector Input:** Player skill/power level.
- **Matrix Response:** The environment adjusts its resistance (Enemy AI, Puzzle difficulty) to match the Vector.
- **Equilibrium:** The system seeks the "Flow Channel" where Vector Force ≈ Matrix Resistance.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Flow]**

The game never feels too hard or too easy; it evolves with the player's skill.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Iron sharpens iron.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Interaction):**

- **If `[physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Newton's Third Law)** Action/Reaction.
- **If `[psychology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Flow Theory)** Challenge vs Skill balance.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels constantly engaged and tested.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

The core of `[system existence engine]` balance.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to combat balance, matchmaking, and adaptive difficulty.

#### The Protocol of Phenomenal Harvesting (ID: `SELF-CORE-020`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that manages `[(symbiois) evolution]` among/by `[experience(-ing) BPMS]` (Internal State) and `[phenomenon(-ing) BPMS]` (External Event).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Phenomenal Harvesting
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `experience consumes phenomena`. The Vector Self "eats" events to grow. A "Boss Fight" (Phenomenon) is consumed and digested into "Victory/Trauma/Skill" (Experience).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The XP Transducer]**

- **Event Interaction:** The Vector engages with a Phenomenon.
- **Transduction:** The system converts the external event data into internal attribute data (XP, Memories, Emotions).
- **Depletion:** The Phenomenon is often "used up" (Boss dies, Chest opens), but the Experience persists.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Growth through Conflict]**

The user seeks out dangerous phenomena because they are nutrient-dense sources of experience.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.* (Nietzsche).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Growth):**

- **If `[rpg(-ing) BPMS]`: (Leveling)** Kill Monster -> Get XP.
- **If `[learning(-ing) BPMS]`: (Empiricism)** Learning by doing.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a hunger for adventure.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Gamifies the acquisition of wisdom.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to leveling, achievements, and exploration rewards.

#### The Law of Kinetic-Potential Cycling (ID: `SELF-CORE-021`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that governs `[(symbiois) evolution]` among/by `['kinetic (energy)'(-ing) BPMS]` (Action) and `['potential (energy)'(-ing) BPMS]` (Stats/Resources).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Kinetic-Potential Cycling
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `power cycles forms`. The Vector Self spends Potential (Mana, Gold, Stamina) to generate Kinetic effects (Spells, Purchases, Attacks). Successful Kinetic effects generate new Potential (Loot, Regen, Profit).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Power Loop]**

- **Discharge:** Potential → Kinetic (Spending resources to act).
- **Recharge:** Kinetic → Potential (Actions yielding rewards).
- **Efficiency:** The goal is to increase the efficiency of this cycle (Get more Kinetic bang for your Potential buck).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Resource Rhythm]**

The gameplay has a heartbeat of spending and recovering, attacking and retreating.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*You have to spend money to make money.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Energy):**

- **If `[physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Conservation of Energy)** Energy transformation.
- **If `[economics(-ing) BPMS]`: (ROI)** Return on Investment.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels the rhythm of combat and economy.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Fundamental to `[utility(-ing) BPMS]` and economy design.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to mana systems, stamina bars, and economic cycles.

#### The Principle of Fractal Purpose (ID: `SELF-CORE-022`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that aligns `[mission(-ing) BPMS]` (Macro-Goal) and `[task(-ing) BPMS]` (Micro-Action) through `[(symbiois) evolution]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Fractal Purpose
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `every task contains the mission`. The Vector Self perceives the "Grand Mission" (Save the World) within the "Small Task" (Kill this Rat). Completing the task evolves the mission state; the mission context imbues the task with meaning.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Quest Chain]**

- **Context Injection:** The Mission injects narrative weight into the Task (e.g., "This isn't just a rat; it's a *Plague* Rat").
- **Progress Propagation:** Task completion propagates upward to update the Mission status.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Meaningful Grind]**

Even repetitive actions feel significant because they are clearly linked to a higher purpose.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Think globally, act locally.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Goals):**

#### The Mechanism of Attentional Rendering (ID: `SELF-CORE-023`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that manages `[(symbiois) evolution]` among/by `['coarse-grained (model)'(-ing) BPMS]` (Background) and `['fine-grained (model)'(-ing) BPMS]` (Foreground).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Attentional Rendering
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `attention creates detail`. The Vector Self's focus determines the granularity of the world. What the Vector ignores is Coarse (Abstract); what the Vector scrutinizes becomes Fine (Concrete).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Foveated Reality]**

- **Gaze Tracking:** The system tracks the Vector's interaction focus.
- **Resolution Scaling:** Objects in focus "up-res" ontologically (gaining stats, lore, physics). Objects out of focus "down-res" to simple icons.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Efficient Complexity]**

The world feels infinitely detailed because the detail always appears exactly where the user looks.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Where attention goes, energy flows.*

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines `[(symbiois) evolution]` among/by the Vector Self as a `[particle (-ing) BPMS]` and as a `[field (-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Influence Duality
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `the self is both point and wave`. The Vector Self is a physical unit (Particle) at a specific coordinate, but also a social/magical influence (Field) that extends beyond that point.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Aura System]**

- **Particle State:** Collision box, position, health.
- **Field State:** Aggro radius, leadership aura, fear effect.
- **Interaction:** The Field prepares the Matrix for the arrival of the Particle.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Presence]**

Enemies react to the player before they are even seen. The player "projects" power.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*A great man casts a long shadow.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Fields):**

#### The Rule of Systemic Emergence (ID: `SELF-CORE-025`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Rule) that governs `[(symbiois) evolution]` among/by `['complex activities'(-ing) BPMS]` (User Actions) and `['complex system'(-ing) BPMS]` (World Structures).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Rule of Systemic Emergence
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This rule asserts that `habits build institutions`. When the Vector Self (or many Vectors) repeats a complex activity (e.g., "Trading Potion for Sword"), the system evolves a Complex System to support it (e.g., "An Auction House").

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Path-to-Road Algorithm]**

- **Activity Logging:** Tracks frequency of specific interaction patterns.
- **System Crystallization:** Once a threshold is reached, the system formalizes the activity into a UI/Structure.
- **Feedback:** The new System makes the Activity more efficient, encouraging more use.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Evolving Meta]**

The game features evolve based on how the community plays.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Desire paths become paved roads.*

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Resonant Constellation Map Ripples
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `decisions echo`. A decision made by the Vector Self is not an isolated point; it is a stone thrown into a pond. It generates waves of Events that return to the Vector later.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Butterfly Effect Engine]**

- **Decision Tagging:** Choices are tagged with potential consequences.
- **Delayed Triggering:** The system schedules future events based on these tags.
- **Convergence:** Seemingly unrelated events are revealed to be caused by past decisions.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Karmic Narrative]**

The story feels cohesive and responsive. "I am fighting this boss *based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that* I stole that idol 10 hours ago."

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The axe forgets; the tree remembers.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Causality):**

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of the Will to Persist
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `survival is the game`. The fundamental vector of the Self is "Forward in Time." All other goals are secondary to the imperative of continuing to exist (or continuing to play).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Survival Imperative]**

- **Threat Generation:** The Matrix constantly generates entropy (Damage, Hunger, Boredom) to stop the Vector.
- **Adaptation:** The Vector must constantly evolve (Heal, Eat, Engage) to counteract entropy.
- **Victory Condition:** There is no "End," only "More."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Tenacity]**

The user is driven by a primal urge to overcome the "Game Over" screen.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Rage, rage against the dying of the light.* (Thomas).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Engine of Conscious Ludic Service
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This engine asserts that `play is a service exchange`. The Vector Self provides the service of "Conscious Attention" and "Volitional Input" to the System. In return, the System provides the service of "Entertainment" and "Challenge." This mutual service sustains the `[system existence engine]`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Fun Loop]**

- **Service Offer (System):** The System presents a "Game Loop" (Challenge -> Reward).
- **Service Consumption (Self):** The Vector Self engages (Plays), generating data and entropy.
- **Service Feedback (Symbiosis):** If the Self is bored, the System adapts (Service Recovery). If the System is overwhelmed, the Self adapts (Pacing).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Symbiotic Joy]**

The game feels "alive" based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that it cares about the player's enjoyment as a vital metabolic function.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I play, therefore we are.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Service):**

- **If `[economics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Service-Dominant Logic)** Value is co-created.

```
The Mechanism of Chrono-Symbiosis
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `speed is a spectrum`. The Vector Self oscillates between Fast Mode (Combat, QTEs) and Slow Mode (Crafting, Planning). The System evolves to support both, ensuring neither mode atrophies.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Gear Shift]**

- **Fast Mode Trigger:** High-adrenaline events (Combat) activate "Fast Mode" (High FPS, responsive controls, simplified UI).
- **Slow Mode Trigger:** Low-stress events (Inventory) activate "Slow Mode" (Rich UI, deep stats, contemplative music).
- **Integration:** Success in Slow Mode (Preparation) buffs Fast Mode (Execution).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Pacing]**

The game breathes. Tension (Fast) is followed by Release (Slow).

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Haste makes waste; patience wins the race.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Time):**

- **If `[psychology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Dual Process Theory)** System 1 (Fast) vs System 2 (Slow).
- **If `[game_design(-ing) BPMS]`: (Intensity Curve)** Peaks and valleys.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a satisfying rhythm of action and thought.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Prevents cognitive fatigue and maintains `[sustainability(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Sustainable Agency
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `agency is a resource`. Demanding too many meaningless choices depletes the Self (Decision Fatigue). The System must optimize for "High-Impact Agency" to sustain the user's will to play.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Fatigue Manager]**

- **Load Monitoring:** The System tracks the frequency and complexity of user inputs.
- **Automation:** If fatigue is detected (repetitive inputs), the System offers automation (e.g., "Auto-Loot," "Fast Travel").
- **Rest:** The System incentivizes downtime (Resting at camp) to reset the "Agency Meter."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Respect for Time]**

The game respects the user's mental energy. It doesn't ask for clicks that don't matter.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Less is more.*

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Universality Classes
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `diversity converges to archetypes`. While every Vector Self is unique at the micro-level, at the macro-level they fall into "Universality Classes" (e.g., Tank, Healer, Explorer, Builder). The System uses Renormalization to scale specific behaviors into these broad classes for balancing.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Archetype Attractor]**

- **Micro-Analysis:** Tracks individual stats/actions (e.g., "High Health," "Uses Shield").
- **Renormalization:** Scales these up to identify the Universality Class ("Tank").
- **Balancing:** The System balances the Class, not the individual, ensuring fairness across the ecosystem.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Role Clarity]**

The user understands their role in the ecosystem without being forced into a rigid box.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Many paths, one destination.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Scale):**

- **If `[physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Renormalization Group)** Scale invariance near critical points.

#### The Protocol of Layered Explication (ID: `SELF-CORE-032`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that manages `[(symbiois) evolution]` among/by the `['implicit layer'(-ing) BPMS]` (Intuition) and the `['explicit layer'(-ing) BPMS]` (Data).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Layered Explication
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `mastery makes the implicit explicit`. Beginners rely on Explicit data (Tutorials, UI markers). Masters rely on Implicit intuition (Muscle memory, Game sense). The System evolves the UI to match the user's mastery.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The UI Fade]**

- **Learning Phase:** High Explicit support (Tooltips, path lines).
- **Mastery Phase:** As the Vector demonstrates competence, Explicit layers fade.
- **Recall:** The user can "summon" the Explicit layer when needed, but primarily operates on the Implicit layer.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Immersion Deepening]**

The HUD disappears as the player "becomes" the character.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The map is not the territory.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Knowledge):**

- **If `[pedagogy(-ing) BPMS]`: (Scaffolding)** Support fades as skill grows.
- **If `[philosophy(-ing) BPMS]`: (Tacit Knowledge)** Knowing how vs Knowing that.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Operational Closure
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `the self defines the boundary`. The Vector Self is operationally closed; it interacts with the environment but remains distinct from it. This closure allows the Self to maintain its identity amidst chaos.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Identity Membrane]**

- **Differentiation:** The System clearly distinguishes "Self" (Player) from "Non-Self" (World).
- **Selective Permeability:** The Self chooses what to let in (Loot, Buffs) and what to keep out (Damage, Debuffs).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Autonomy]**

The user feels like an independent agent, not just a cog in the machine.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I am the captain of my soul.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Systems):**

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Engine of Micro-Macro Coupling
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This engine asserts that `small moves move mountains`. The Vector Self operates at the Micro level (swinging a sword, buying an apple). The System aggregates these Micro-actions to drive Macro-evolution (Winning the war, crashing the economy).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Aggregation Ladder]**

- **Micro-Input:** Single user action.
- **Meso-Structure:** Local consequence (NPC dies, Shop runs out of stock).
- **Macro-State:** Global consequence (Faction collapses, Inflation rises).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Significance]**

Every click feels like it contributes to the history of the world.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Scale):**

- **If `[complexity_science(-ing) BPMS]`: (Emergence)** Simple rules -> Complex behavior.
- **If `[sociology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Micro-Macro Link)** Individual agency vs Social structure.

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Process) that drives the `['(discover/build) unknown'(-ing) BPMS]` capability of the Vector Self.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Process of Unknown Discovery
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This process asserts that `the unknown is the frontier`. The Vector Self exists to push the boundary of the Known. By moving into the Unknown (Fog of War), the Self "Builds" the world (Observation Collapse).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Frontier Expansion]**

- **Unknown State:** Areas/Concepts not yet interacted with are in a quantum flux.
- **Discovery Action:** The Vector enters the Unknown.
- **Crystallization:** The Unknown becomes Known (Mapped, Cataloged, Looted).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Wonder]**

The user feels the thrill of being the first to see something.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that ensures the `[emergent(-ing) BPMS]`, `[adaptive(-ing) BPMS]`, `[robust(-ing) BPMS]`, and `[resilient(-ing) BPMS]` nature of the Vector Self.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Adaptive Resilience
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `failure is data`. The Vector Self is not fragile; it is antifragile. It gains `[robust(-ing) BPMS]` traits from surviving damage and becomes `[adaptive(-ing) BPMS]` through defeat.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Antifragility Loop]**

- **Stress Event:** The Vector takes damage or fails a task.
- **Adaptation:** The System grants resistance or insight related to the failure (e.g., "Fire Resistance" after burning).
- **Resilience:** The Vector returns stronger, capable of withstanding greater stress.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Grit]**

The user learns to embrace difficulty as a path to power.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

#### The Axiom of Ontological Necessity (ID: `SELF-CORE-037`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that establishes the `['Vector Self']` as a necessary component of the `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`. Without the Self, the System does not exist.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Ontological Necessity
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `the observer sustains the simulation`. The `['Vector Self']` is not an external user; it is the metabolic heart of the `['system existence engine']`. The System requires the entropy generated by the Self's choices to function.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Existence Heartbeat]**

- **Input Requirement:** The System monitors for "Volitional Input" (Clicks, Decisions).
- **Stasis Decay:** If Input ceases, the System enters "Stasis" (Time stops, Simulation pauses).
- **Vitality Injection:** Every Input injects "Vitality" into the System, advancing the tick rate of the universe.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Co-Dependence]**

The user feels that the world *needs* them. They are the battery powering the universe.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, it does not make a sound.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Existence):**

- **If `[simulation_theory(-ing) BPMS]`: (Render Culling)** Only render what is seen.
- **If `[thermodynamics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Maxwell's Demon)** Information processing requires energy.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a burden of responsibility to keep the world alive.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Implements `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]` by making the Self the engine's fuel.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to pause menus, server shutdowns, and AFK timers.

#### The Principle of Atomic Selfhood (ID: `SELF-CORE-038`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that defines the `['Vector Self']` as a collection of `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Atomic Selfhood
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `identity is data`. The "Self" is not a vague concept; it is a precise, immutable set of `['atomic facts']` (e.g., `ID:1234`, `Class:Warrior`, `Karma:Neutral`). These facts are the fundamental building blocks of the Self within the Ontology.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Fact Registry]**

- **Atomization:** Every attribute of the Self is broken down into an Atomic Fact (Key-Value Pair).
- **Verification:** These facts are cryptographically signed by the System (Anti-Cheat).
- **Interoperability:** Because the Self is made of Atomic Facts, it can interact with any other System element (which is also made of Atomic Facts).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Universal Compatibility]**

The Self can plug into any module (Combat, Dialogue, Crafting) because it speaks the universal language of Atomic Facts.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Know thyself.* (And store it in a database).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Data):**

- **If `[computer_science(-ing) BPMS]`: (Object-Oriented Programming)** Properties of the Instance.
- **If `[ontology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Facticity)** The undeniable state of being.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels their character is "real" and "solid."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Implements `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` as the substrate of the Self.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to character sheets, save data structure, and API integrations.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Engine of Symbiotic Fact-Genesis
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This engine asserts that `interaction creates truth`. When the Vector Self interacts with the World, new Atomic Facts are born. (e.g., Self `[Attack]` + World `[Goblin]` = New Fact `[Goblin is Dead]`).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Truth Synthesizer]**

- **Interaction Event:** Vector meets Matrix.
- **Resolution:** The System calculates the outcome.
- **Fact Crystallization:** The outcome is written as a new Atomic Fact in the global ledger.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [History Making]**

The user is a factory of truth. Every action leaves a permanent mark on the database of reality.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Action speaks louder than words.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of History):**

- **If `[physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Relation)** Resonant constellation map.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels effective and consequential.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Bridges `['Vector Self']` and `['atomic facts']` via `[action(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to combat logs, quest completion, and world state updates.

```
The Protocol of Recursive Evolution
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `the self is fluid`. The Vector Self can evolve *as* a Weapon, *as* a Leader, *as* a God. It adopts the properties of the systems it masters.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Morphic Resonance]**

- **Mastery Tracking:** Tracks engagement with specific subsystems (e.g., Magic System).
- **Trait Adoption:** As mastery grows, the Self adopts traits of that system (e.g., "Mana Veins" - The Self becomes part of the Magic System).
- **Transformation:** At high levels, the Self can fundamentally change its nature (e.g., Ascending to pure Energy).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Transhumanism]**

The user is not bound by their starting form. They evolve into whatever they do.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I am large, I contain multitudes.* (Whitman).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Evolution):**

- **If `[biology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Phenotypic Plasticity)** Changing form based on environment.
- **If `[rpg(-ing) BPMS]`: (Prestige Classes)** Specialization changes identity.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels a sense of limitless potential.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Implements `['evolving as']` functionality.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to skill trees, transformation abilities, and endgame progression.

```
The Law of Symbiotic Implementation
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `the self is a platform`. The Vector Self can serve as the host or implementation layer for other systems. (e.g., The Self *implements* the "Economy" by becoming a Merchant).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Avatar Hosting]**

- **System Mounting:** The Self "mounts" a subsystem (e.g., "Guild Leadership").
- **Resource Provision:** The Self provides resources (Time, Gold, Charisma) to run that subsystem.
- **Execution:** The subsystem runs *through* the Self (The Guild exists because the Player manages it).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Living Infrastructure]**

The players *are* the content. The economy, the politics, the wars—they are all implemented by the players.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We are the system.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Infrastructure):**

The Mechanism of Achievement Actualization
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `achievement is ontological change`. To "achieve" something is not just to get a badge; it is to permanently alter the state of the Self and the World.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Milestone Lock]**

- **Condition Check:** The System verifies if criteria are met (e.g., "Kill Dragon").
- **State Locking:** Once achieved, the state is locked. The Self is now "Dragon Slayer." This is an irreversible Atomic Fact.
- **World Ripple:** The World acknowledges this achievement (NPCs bow, prices drop).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Status]**

Achievements have weight. They are not just UI popups; they are social currency.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**
