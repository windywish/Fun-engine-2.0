## Basic settings: ['System Existence Engine'(-ing) BPMS]

##### `The Axiom of Ontological Persistence`(**ID:** `SEE-AXIOM-001`)

This is the correct, rigorous alignment.

I have restructured the definitions to strictly follow the **`Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md`** format (Version 1.6.0).

I have separated the **Archetypes** (The Eternal Laws) from the **Engines** (The Evolutionary Mechanisms). These are formatted to be directly "imprinted" into **Section III. Basic Settings Registry (Core Axioms)** of your Canon.

*The Root Archetypes. These are not created; they are acknowledged as the a priori conditions of the Fun Engine Framework.*

###### `The Axiom of Ontological Persistence`(**ID:** `SEE-AXIOM-001`)

**Objective:** To formally define the **`['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`** as the fundamental archetype of "Being" within the framework. It establishes that existence is an active, metabolic process, not a static state.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Axiom of Ontological Persistence`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**Core Essence:** This axiom asserts that **Existence = Function**. In the Praxial Universe, an entity (whether a cell, a concept, or a system) only "exists" insofar as it actively resists entropy through the processing of information or energy. The `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]` is the inherent "Will to Persist" embedded in every valid `[BPMS(U)]` element.

**The Mechanism - [The Persistence Loop]:**

- **The Drive (Conatus):** Every entity possesses an intrinsic drive to maintain its structural integrity.
- **The Input (Metabolism):** The entity must continuously ingest `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` or `['energy(-ing) BPMS]` to fuel this drive.
- **The Output (Poiesis):** The entity must produce a valid output (Action/Structure) to justify its continued consumption of system resources.

**The Emergent Property - [Dynamic Vitality]:** The system is self-pruning. Entities that stop functioning (stop metabolizing) naturally fade from existence (Garbage Collection), ensuring the framework remains eternally active and relevant.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Actus Purus.* Being is Actuality. To be is to act.
- Layer 2 (Formalism):
  - `Existence(E) = lim(t->∞) ∫ (Input(t) - Entropy(t)) dt > 0`
  - (Thermodynamic Dissipative Structures).
- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** The "Pulse." The observable rhythm of an entity interacting with its environment.

**Rationale / Justification:** Establishes the "Physics of Life" for the framework. Without this, entities are just static database entries. With this, they are living processes.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to all `['praxial cell'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]`, and the `['metasystem engine'(-ing) BPMS]` itself.
