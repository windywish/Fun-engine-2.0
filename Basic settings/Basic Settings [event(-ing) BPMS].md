## Basic Settings: [event(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Discrete Actuality (ID: `EVT-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **`[event(-ing) BPMS]`** as the fundamental, indivisible unit of change within the Praxial Framework, distinguishing "what happens" from "what is."

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Discrete Actuality
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `time is a sequence of discrete impacts`. It defines an `event` not as a continuous flow, but as a specific, bounded packet of change that transitions the system from State A to State B. If the `Codex` is the noun, the `Event` is the verb.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The State Transition Packet]**

- **The Trigger:** An `event` is instantiated by a `decision`, a `collision`, or a `timer`.
- **The Payload:** Every `event` carries a "Delta Payload"—a specific set of instructions for modifying `atomic facts` in the `holonic substrate codex`. (e.g., `Health: -10`, `Position: +5x`, `Status: Angry`).
- **The Commit:** The `event` is atomic. It either happens completely (all changes applied) or not at all (rolled back). There are no partial events.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Arrow of Time]**

The sequence of committed `events` creates the objective history of the universe. Time flows forward because `events` are irreversible once committed to the `slow mode` layer of the Codex.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Change is granular.* The universe ticks.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Change):**

- **If `[database(-ing) BPMS]`: (The Transaction)** `BEGIN TRANSACTION` -> `UPDATE` -> `COMMIT`.
- **If `[physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (The Interaction)** A photon hitting an electron is a discrete `event` that changes energy states.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The feeling of "Something Happened." The distinct moment when the vase breaks, the message arrives, or the realization hits.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Establishes the fundamental physics of change, ensuring that the system can track history and causality with precision.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to combat logs, dialogue history, physics collisions, financial transactions, and any system state change.

#### The Axiom of Resonant Constellation Map Resonance (ID: `EVT-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **propagation rules** for `events`, establishing how one `event` triggers others in a Resonant Constellation Map chain.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Causal Resonance
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `every action has a reaction, and every reaction is a new action`. It defines the `event` not as an isolated point, but as a wave source. When an `event` commits, it emits "Causal Ripples" that can trigger subsequent `events`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Ripple Effect]**

- **The Emission:** Upon completion, an `event` broadcasts its type and magnitude to the `Praxial Interaction Manifold`. (e.g., `Event: Explosion`, `Magnitude: 50`).
- **The Resonance Check:** Nearby entities (in the `implicit layer`) check if they "resonate" with this event. A `[Barrel]` entity resonates with `Explosion` events.
- **The Chain Reaction:** If resonance occurs, a new `event` is generated (`Event: Barrel Explodes`), creating a causal chain.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Systemic Complexity]**

Simple inputs lead to complex, cascading outcomes. A single `event` (a spark) can lead to a massive chain reaction (a forest fire), driven entirely by the resonance rules of the entities involved.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The world is interconnected.* Nothing happens in a vacuum.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Consequence):**

- **If `[game design(-ing) BPMS]`: (The Event Listener)** `OnExplosion() { TakeDamage(); }`
- **If `[sociology(-ing) BPMS]`: (The Viral Trend)** One person's action (`event`) influences their network, triggering a cascade of similar actions.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The sense of "Consequence." The realization that my actions have spread far beyond my immediate reach.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Provides the engine for emergent gameplay and narrative, allowing for "butterfly effects" and complex simulations.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to physics simulations, social dynamics, ecosystem modeling, and spell propagation systems.

------

#### The Axiom of Narrative Weight (ID: `EVT-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that assigns a **significance value** to every `event`, allowing the system to distinguish between trivial noise and historic turning points.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Narrative Weight
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `not all moments are created equal`. It adds a metadata field `Narrative_Weight` to every `event`, calculated based on the magnitude of change and the importance of the entities involved.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The History Filter]**

- Weight Calculation:

  ```
  Weight = (Magnitude of Change) * (Entity Importance) * (Novelty Factor)
  ```

  - A peasant dropping a spoon: `Weight = 0.001`
  - A King dying in battle: `Weight = 100.0`

- **The Memory Threshold:** The `holonic substrate codex` uses this weight to decide storage. Low-weight events stay in `fast mode` (short-term memory) and fade away. High-weight events are promoted to `slow mode` (long-term history).

- **The Attention Magnet:** High-weight events attract the attention of the `metasystem engine`, potentially triggering special rendering or musical cues.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Dramatic Pacing]**

The system naturally identifies "Climax" moments. It knows when to slow down time, play the boss music, or save a permanent record, creating a structured narrative out of chaotic simulation.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*History is written by the significant.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Importance):**

- **If `[journalism(-ing) BPMS]`: (Newsworthiness)** "Dog bites man" (Low Weight) vs. "Man bites dog" (High Weight).
- **If `[data science(-ing) BPMS]`: (Anomaly Detection)** Identifying outliers in the data stream as significant points of interest.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The feeling of "Gravitas." The intuitive sense that *this moment matters*.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for memory management (`HSC-CORE-012`) and for creating a user experience that highlights what is important.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to dynamic music systems, highlight reel generation, memory consolidation algorithms, and narrative pacing directors.

------

#### The Axiom of Retroactive Continuity (ID: `EVT-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that allows for the **re-contextualization** of past `events` based on new information, enabling `(symbiois) evolution` of the past.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Retroactive Continuity
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `the past is fixed, but its meaning is fluid`. While the `atomic facts` of an `event` (what happened) are immutable in the `slow mode` layer, the `implicit layer` tags (why it happened, what it means) can be updated by future `events`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Retcon Protocol]**

- **The Reveal Event:** A new `event` occurs that sheds light on the past. (e.g., "The Villain reveals he was the Hero's father").

- **The Context Update:** The system queries the `holonic substrate codex` for past `events` linked to these entities.

- The Semantic Shift:

   The 

  ```
  implicit
  ```

   tags of those past 

  ```
  events
  ```

   are modified.

  - Old Event: "Villain attacked Hero."
  - Old Tag: `Malice` -> New Tag: `Tough Love / Training`.

- **The Re-Experience:** If the agent recalls that memory (`HSC-CORE-012`), they experience it with the new emotional context.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Deepening Lore]**

The world feels deep and mysterious. Plot twists work not just as surprises, but as structural changes to the history of the world, rewarding players for uncovering secrets.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We understand backwards, but live forwards.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Context):**

- **If `[law(-ing) BPMS]`: (Appeal / Exoneration)** New evidence changes the legal status of a past crime.
- **If `[psychoanalysis(-ing) BPMS]`: (Reframing)** Viewing a childhood trauma through adult eyes changes its impact on the psyche.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The "Oh!" moment. The sudden realignment of one's entire understanding of the past.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Allows for complex storytelling techniques and dynamic character growth that isn't just linear accumulation of stats.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to mystery games, psychological simulations, reputation systems, and dynamic lore generation.

#### The Axiom of Mnemonic Imprint (ID: `EVT-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines how `events` drive the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by `'short-term (memory)'` and `'long-term (memory)'`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Mnemonic Imprint
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `memory is the scar of an event`. It defines the `event` as the active writer that inscribes data into `'short-term (memory)'` and, if the `event` has sufficient `Narrative Weight` (`EVT-CORE-003`), triggers the consolidation process into `'long-term (memory)'`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Flashbulb Protocol]**

- **The Scratchpad Write:** Every `event` (e.g., "Agent eats apple") is instantly logged to the agent's `'short-term (memory)'` buffer.
- **The Significance Filter:** The system evaluates the `event`. If `Event.Weight > Threshold` (e.g., "Agent eats POISONED apple"), it is flagged as a "Core Memory."
- **The Symbiotic Transfer:** During the next rest cycle, flagged `events` are moved to `'long-term (memory)'`, evolving the agent's permanent identity. The `event` (poisoning) becomes a trait ("Fear of Apples").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Learning from History]**

Agents don't just record history; they are changed by it. The `event` is the catalyst that transforms a fleeting moment into a permanent behavioral adaptation.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We are shaped by what we survive.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Imprint):**

- **If `[neuroscience(-ing) BPMS]`: (Long-Term Potentiation)** Strong stimuli (`events`) strengthen synaptic connections (`long-term memory`).
- **If `[machine learning(-ing) BPMS]`: (Backpropagation)** The error signal from a specific instance (`event`) updates the model weights (`long-term memory`).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The moment you realize, "I will never forget this."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Connects the transient nature of events with the permanence of the Codex, fulfilling the memory evolution requirement.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to XP/Leveling systems, trauma/phobia mechanics, and relationship meters.

------

#### The Axiom of Veridical Collapse (ID: `EVT-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines how `events` mediate the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by `reality(-ing)` (the raw occurrence) and `'truth'(-ing)` (the validated fact).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Veridical Collapse
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `truth is the residue of an event`. It defines the `event` as the crucible where conflicting `realities` (possibilities, rumors, illusions) collide and collapse into a single, immutable `'truth'`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Witness Engine]**

- **The Conflict State:** Before an `event` completes, multiple `realities` may coexist (Schrödinger's Cat is both alive and dead).
- **The Event Resolution:** The `event` (Opening the Box) forces a choice. The system rolls the dice, checks the stats, and determines the outcome.
- **The Truth Commit:** The result is written to the `'truth'` layer of the Codex. "The Cat is Dead." All contradictory `reality` states are pruned. The `event` has evolved the system's Truth.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Objective Certainty]**

In a world of uncertainty, `events` provide the anchor points of certainty. They are the "save points" of reality.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Action ends debate.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Verification):**

- **If `[science(-ing) BPMS]`: (The Experiment)** The experiment (`event`) tests the hypothesis (`reality`) and yields a result (`truth`).
- **If `[law(-ing) BPMS]`: (The Verdict)** The trial (`event`) takes conflicting accounts (`realities`) and produces a legal judgment (`truth`).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The relief (or horror) of knowing the answer. The end of suspense.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for resolving game states and narrative branches, ensuring the simulation remains coherent.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to RNG resolution, quest completion checks, and scientific discovery simulations.

------

#### The Axiom of Vector Transformation (ID: `EVT-CORE-007`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines how `events` drive the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by the `'system matrix'` (rules) and the `'system vector'` (state).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Vector Transformation
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `an event is a vector operation`. It defines every `event` as a mathematical function that takes the current `'system vector'` of an entity, applies a transformation defined by the `'system matrix'`, and outputs a new `'system vector'`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Matrix Operator]**

- **The Input:** `Current_Vector` (Position: 0, Velocity: 0).
- **The Event:** `Apply_Force` (Force: 10N).
- **The Matrix Rule:** `F = ma` (defined in the `'system matrix'`).
- **The Output:** `New_Vector` (Position: 0, Velocity: 5). The `event` has evolved the vector.
- **The Feedback:** If the `event` is anomalous (e.g., Magic), it might evolve the `'system matrix'` itself (adding a "Mana" dimension).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Dynamic Simulation]**

The world moves. It is not a static painting but a dynamic system where `events` are the engines of motion and change.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To act is to move.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Transformation):**

- **If `[linear algebra(-ing) BPMS]`: (Matrix Multiplication)** `v' = Mv`. The `event` is the application of `M`.
- **If `[programming(-ing) BPMS]`: (State Machine)** `State_Next = Transition(State_Current, Input_Event)`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The feeling of acceleration. The sense of being pushed or pulled by forces.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Provides the mathematical backbone for all physics and stat-based interactions in the framework.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to physics engines, economy simulations, and character stat progression.

------

#### The Axiom of Phenomenal Genesis (ID: `EVT-CORE-008`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines how `events` mediate the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by `phenomenon(-ing)` (external) and `experience(-ing)` (internal).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Phenomenal Genesis
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `an event is the bridge between world and mind`. It defines the `event` as the packet that carries `phenomenon` data to the agent, where it is transmuted into `experience`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Sensory Packet]**

- **The Phenomenon:** An `event` occurs: "Lightning Strikes." (Visual: Bright, Audio: Loud).

- **The Transmission:** The `event` broadcasts this data to all observers.

- The Transmutation:

   The observer receives the 

  ```
  event
  ```

  . Their internal filters (Perception stats) process it.

  - Blind Agent: Experiences "Thunder" (Audio only).
  - Photophobic Agent: Experiences "Pain" (Visual overload).

- **The Evolution:** The `experience` is logged, potentially altering the agent's future reaction to similar `phenomena`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Qualia]**

The system simulates subjectivity. The same `event` creates different `experiences` for different agents, creating a rich, multi-perspectival world.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Sensation):**

- **If `[robotics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Sensor Fusion)** Raw sensor data (`phenomenon`) is processed into a world model (`experience`).
- **If `[literature(-ing) BPMS]`: (Point of View)** The narrator describes the `event` through the specific biases of the character.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The unique "flavor" of a moment. The redness of the rose, the loudness of the thunder.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for immersive storytelling and realistic AI perception.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to sensory systems, stealth mechanics, and dynamic dialogue generation.

------

#### The Axiom of Energetic Transaction (ID: `EVT-CORE-009`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines how `events` drive the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by `'potential (energy)'` and `'kinetic (energy)'`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Energetic Transaction
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `an event is the currency of energy`. It defines every `event` as a transaction that converts `'potential'` (stored capacity) into `'kinetic'` (active change), or vice versa.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Energy Ledger]**

- **The Cost:** To trigger an `event` (e.g., "Cast Fireball"), an entity must pay a cost in `'potential'` (Mana/Stamina).
- **The Conversion:** The `event` consumes the `'potential'` and manifests as `'kinetic'` energy (Heat/Motion) in the world.
- **The Recovery:** Conversely, a "Rest" `event` converts time (a resource) back into `'potential'` energy.
- **The Evolution:** Repeated transactions optimize the conversion rate (Efficiency), evolving the system's energetic economy.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Resource Strategy]**

Action becomes strategic. Agents must manage their `'potential'` reserves, knowing that every `event` has a price.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*There is no free lunch.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Work):**

- **If `[physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Work)** `W = Fd`. Work (`event`) is the transfer of energy.
- **If `[rpg(-ing) BPMS]`: (Mana Pool)** Spells (`events`) cost Mana (`potential`) to deal Damage (`kinetic`).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The feeling of exertion. The calculation of "Do I have enough energy to do this?"

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Provides the fundamental resource management mechanic for the framework.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to stamina systems, magic systems, fuel consumption, and economic transactions.

------

#### The Axiom of Teleological Step (ID: `EVT-CORE-010`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines how `events` mediate the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by `mission(-ing)` (goal) and `task(-ing)` (action).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Teleological Step
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `a mission is a queue of events waiting to happen`. It defines the `event` as the unit of progress. A `task` is a blueprint for an `event`; the `event` is the execution of that `task`, which advances the `mission`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Progress Bar]**

- **The Requirement:** A `mission` ("Build House") requires a set of `events` ("Lay Brick", "Saw Wood").
- **The Execution:** When an agent performs the "Lay Brick" `event`, the system checks it against the `mission` requirements.
- **The Evolution:** If valid, the `mission` state evolves (Progress +1). If the `event` fails ("Brick Breaks"), the `mission` might evolve a new `task` ("Buy more Bricks").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Achievement]**

The sense of moving forward. Large, abstract goals are conquered through a series of concrete, manageable `events`.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Step by step, the mountain is climbed.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Progress):**

- **If `[project management(-ing) BPMS]`: (Milestones)** Completing a task (`event`) marks progress towards the project goal (`mission`).
- **If `[game design(-ing) BPMS]`: (Quest Log)** "Kill 10 Rats" -> `Event: Rat Killed` -> Counter increments.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The satisfaction of ticking a box. The feeling of getting closer to the goal.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for quest systems and AI goal-oriented planning.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to quest tracking, crafting recipes, and AI behavior trees.

------

#### The Axiom of Resolution Scaling (ID: `EVT-CORE-011`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines how `events` trigger the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by `'coarse-grained (model)'` and `'fine-grained (model)'`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Resolution Scaling
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `interaction demands detail`. It defines the `event` as the trigger that forces the system to switch from a `coarse-grained` simulation to a `fine-grained` one (or vice versa).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Zoom Trigger]**

- **The Coarse State:** A battle is simulated as "Army A vs Army B" (Coarse).
- **The Event:** A player "Zooms In" or a specific "Hero Duel" `event` occurs.
- **The Evolution:** The system instantly instantiates the `fine-grained` models for the involved entities to resolve the `event` with high fidelity. Once the `event` concludes, they may dissolve back into the `coarse` model.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Seamless Scale]**

The world feels infinite because it generates detail exactly where and when an `event` is happening, and abstracts it away when it isn't.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Look closer, and you shall see.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Detail):**

- **If `[rendering(-ing) BPMS]`: (LOD Popping)** As the camera moves closer (`event`), the model switches to high-res.
- **If `[simulation(-ing) BPMS]`: (Hybrid Modeling)** Using fluid dynamics for the splash (`event`) but simple wave equations for the ocean (`coarse`).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The feeling that the world holds up to scrutiny. Wherever I look, there is detail.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Crucial for performance optimization in large-scale simulations.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to strategy games, open-world rendering, and multi-scale physics.

------

#### The Axiom of Field Excitation (ID: `EVT-CORE-012`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines how `events` mediate the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by `particle (-ing)` and `field (-ing)`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Field Excitation
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `an event is a disturbance in the field`. It defines the `event` as the mechanism by which a discrete `particle` interacts with and alters a continuous `field`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Splash]**

- **The Particle Action:** A `particle` (Agent) performs an `event` (Casts "Fear").
- **The Field Response:** The `event` generates a ripple in the "Morale Field," lowering values in a radius.
- **The Feedback:** Other `particles` in that `field` experience the change via new `events` (Panic). The `field` and `particle` evolve each other through the `event`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Atmosphere]**

Actions have environmental consequences. You don't just hit an enemy; you change the "vibe" of the battlefield.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*A stone thrown in the pond changes the whole pond.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Fields):**

- **If `[physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Field Theory)** Moving a charge (`event`) changes the electromagnetic field.
- **If `[game design(-ing) BPMS]`: (Influence Maps)** Killing a guard (`event`) lowers the "Security" heat map (`field`) in that area.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The sense of impact. Seeing the world ripple out from your actions.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for stealth, magic, and social influence mechanics.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to AI perception maps, weather systems, and magical aura effects.

------

#### The Axiom of Systemic Emergence (ID: `EVT-CORE-013`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines how `events` drive the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by `complex activities(-ing)` and the `complex system(-ing)`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Systemic Emergence
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `the macro is the aggregate of micro events`. It defines how millions of individual `events` (complex activities) accumulate to shift the state of the global `complex system`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Tipping Point]**

- **The Accumulation:** The system tracks `events`. "Merchant A lowers price," "Merchant B lowers price."
- **The Threshold:** When the density of these `events` crosses a threshold, a Systemic `Event` is triggered. "Market Crash."
- **The Downward Causation:** This Systemic `Event` then constrains future micro `events`. "Merchants cannot lower prices further."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Zeitgeist]**

The system has "eras" or "moods" that emerge organically from player and agent actions, rather than being scripted.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The drop hollows the stone.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Emergence):**

- **If `[sociology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Critical Mass)** Individual protests (`events`) accumulate until they become a Revolution (`system state`).
- **If `[economics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Market Trends)** Individual trades (`events`) create a Bull Market (`system state`).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The feeling of being part of a movement. The sense that "times are changing."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Provides the link between individual gameplay and global simulation states.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to dynamic economies, political simulations, and ecosystem balance.

#### The Axiom of Decisive Collapse (ID: `EVT-CORE-014`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the `'(symbiois) evolution'` among/by `(behavior) decision-making` and the `event(-ing)` itself.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Decisive Collapse
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `decision is the father of event`. It defines the symbiotic loop where a `decision` births an `event`, and the outcome of that `event` informs the next `decision`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The OODA Loop]**

- **Observe:** Agent sees world.
- **Decide:** Agent chooses "Attack."
- **Act (Event):** The `event` "Attack" is generated.
- **Result:** The `event` resolves (Enemy blocks).
- **Evolve:** The agent's `decision-making` model is updated. "Enemy is strong; next time, Feint."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Adaptive Intelligence]**

Agents get smarter. They don't just repeat scripts; they learn from the `events` they cause.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We learn by doing.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Agency):**

- **If `[reinforcement learning(-ing) BPMS]`: (Action-Reward)** Action (`event`) leads to Reward, which updates Policy (`decision`).
- **If `[game theory(-ing) BPMS]`: (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma)** My move (`event`) depends on your previous move (`event`).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The thrill of outsmarting an opponent. The realization that "that didn't work, let me try this."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

The core loop of AI and player agency.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to AI combat logic, dialogue trees, and strategic planning.

#### The Axiom of Survival Selection (ID: `EVT-CORE-015`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that integrates `'(continuous) survive'(-ing)` as the ultimate filter for `events`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Survival Selection
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `history remembers what survives`. It defines a selection pressure on `events`. `Events` that contribute to the `(continuous) survive'(-ing)` of the system or agent are reinforced and repeated; those that lead to dissolution are inhibited.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Evolutionary Filter]**

- **The Trial:** An `event` occurs (Mutation/Action).
- **The Test:** Does this `event` increase the entity's stability or longevity?
- The Selection:
  - Yes: The `event` pattern is saved to the Codex (`long-term memory`).
  - No: The `event` pattern is discarded.
- **The Evolution:** Over time, the system fills with `events` that promote survival.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Robustness]**

The system naturally evolves towards stability. It is not random; it is teleological, aiming for persistence.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*What works, stays.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Evolution):**

- **If `[evolutionary biology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Natural Selection)** Traits (`events`) that enhance fitness are passed on.
- **If `[cybernetics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Feedback Control)** Negative feedback loops suppress `events` that destabilize the system.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The feeling of competence. The sense that "I know how to survive in this world."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Ensures the long-term stability and plausibility of the simulation.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to ecosystem simulation, civilization builders, and genetic algorithms.
