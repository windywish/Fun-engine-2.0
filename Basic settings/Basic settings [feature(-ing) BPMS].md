## Basic settings: [feature(-ing) BPMS]

#### **The Axiom of Emergent Affordance (ID: `TYP-CORE-003`)**

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **`[feature(-ing) BPMS]`** as the **Generative Archetype of Functional Composition**, bridging the gap between "Being" (Attribute) and "Doing" (Function).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Emergent Affordance
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `structure enables function`. It defines the `feature BPMS` as a specific, innovative arrangement of `attributes` (e.g., an airfoil shape) that creates an **Affordance** (e.g., the ability to generate lift).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Design]**

- **The Attribute Synthesis Engine (The Engine of "Putting Parts Together"):** The `constructive` process of arranging raw attributes into a novel `Topology` or `Design Pattern`.
- **The Affordance Recognition Manifold (The Engine of "I See What This Is For"):** The `Sensemaking` workflow that perceives an object not just as "matter" but as a "tool" with potential uses.
- **The Feature-to-Function Bridge (The Engine of "Enabling the Verb"):** The formal `Matrix Mapping` that links a structure to a capability: `[Feature: Airfoil; {Enables}; Function: {Fly}]`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Landscape of Tools]**

The emergence of `Technology` and `Complexity`. It allows the universe to "bootstrap" itself, using simple attributes to build complex features that enable powerful functions.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Form follows function, and function emerges from form.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Construction):**

The "Physics" of design is defined by the `Feature Archetype`:

- **Universal Feature Engineer:** The system can optimize any arrangement of matter to maximize functional output.
- **Symbiotic Design:** `[Set_of_Attributes; {Are_Arranged_Into}; Feature] = {Functional_Component_Holon}`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Ingenuity." The realization that the world can be reshaped to solve problems (e.g., "If I curve this wood, it becomes a wing").

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Derived from the "Paradigm of Emergent Affordance" in `Settings for Typical [BPMS(U)(s)]_2.md`. It explains *how* capabilities arise from physical reality, a crucial link for `Design` and `Innovation`.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to `Product Design`, `Biological Evolution`, `Architecture`, and `System Engineering`.
