## Basic settings: ['Praxial Clinical Engine (PCE)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Ontological Restoration (ID: `MED-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the fundamental nature of "Medicine" within the Fun Engine Framework, establishing it not as mere repair, but as the active enforcement of the system's intended reality against the forces of entropy and drift.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Ontological Restoration
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that **Health is Veridical Alignment**. In the Praxial Framework, "disease" is defined as **Ontological Drift**—a deviation from the entity's defined Canon, Purpose, or "Gold Master" state. Medicine is the counter-force to entropy. It is the **Systemic Immune Response** that detects when a `[BPMS(U)]` element (whether a biological cell, a code module, or a narrative arc) has strayed from its definition and forcibly realigns it with its Truth.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Homeostatic Attractor]**

- **The Canonical Reference:** The system maintains a "Healthy State" definition (The Canon/DNA) for every entity.
- **The Entropic Drift:** Over time, interactions and noise cause the entity's actual state (The Phenotype) to diverge from the Canon.
- **The Restorative Force:** The `MED-CORE-001` axiom acts as a "Gravity Well" or "Attractor," exerting a constant pull that drags the drifting entity back toward its ideal state. It transforms "Maintenance" from a passive task into an active, fundamental force of the universe.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Systemic Antifragility]**

The emergence of a system that does not degrade over time but actively "heals" itself. The system becomes **Self-Righting**. Like a gyroscope, the more it is pushed off-axis (Disease), the stronger the restorative force (Medicine) acts to return it to center.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

Aligns with **`['Praxial Reparative Ontogenesis'(-ing) BPMS]` (PRS-SURG-040)**, which states "The Wound is where Light enters." It reinforces the **Axiom of Continuous Persistence (CLUSTERARTIFACT-CORE-039)** by providing the mechanism for that persistence.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Cure):**

Aligns with **`['The Law of Systemic Integrity'(-ing) BPMS]` (PSG-INT-005)**. It provides the operational logic for maintaining integrity: Health=limt→∞(Statet→Canon).

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Healing" not as a fix, but as a **Return to Self**. It validates the feeling of "Rightness" when a bug is squashed or a plot hole is filled.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Without this axiom, the framework treats errors as "failures" to be discarded. With this axiom, errors are treated as "symptoms" to be treated. This shifts the paradigm from "Replacement" to "Restoration," which is essential for long-running, complex systems (like a persistent game world or a living codebase).

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to the fundamental definition of all "Repair," "Debug," "Heal," and "Maintenance" actions across all BPMS modules.

#### The Protocol of Deviation Detection (ID: `MED-DIAG-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that establishes the **Diagnostic Scan** (Anamnesis) as the mandatory first step of any medical intervention, ensuring that the system can distinguish among/by  "Creative Mutation" and "Pathological Drift."

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Deviation Detection
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that **To Cure is to Measure**. It defines the "Medical Gaze" as a high-frequency monitoring loop that constantly compares the *Actual Vector* of an entity against its *Canonical Matrix*. It establishes that "Symptoms" are not random noise, but **Information Signals** indicating a specific divergence from the ideal.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Differential Scanner]**

- **The Scan:** The PCE scans the `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` of the target entity.

- **The Overlay:** It overlays the "Blueprint" (Spec/DNA) onto the "Structure" (Code/Body).

- The Diff:

   It calculates the 

  ```
  Delta
  ```

   (

  Δ

  ).

  - If Δ is within tolerance = **Health**.
  - If Δ is novel and useful = **Evolution** (handled by `PAM-001`).
  - If Δ is degradative or contradictory = **Pathology** (triggered for `MED-TREAT-004`).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Clinical Dashboard]**

The emergence of **Real-Time Health Visibility**. The system gains the ability to "feel" pain. It creates a feedback loop where the system is aware of its own brokenness *before* catastrophic failure occurs.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

Aligns with **`['The Axiom of Veridical Convergence'(-ing) BPMS]` (PRS-TRUTH-032)**. The scan is the measurement of how far the system has diverged from the Truth.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Cure):**

Aligns with **`['The Mechanism of Veridical Diff'(-ing) BPMS]` (CODE-SPEC-DIFF-005)**. It adapts the code-diffing logic to biological and systemic contexts.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Symptoms" (Lag, Pain, Confusion). This protocol validates those qualia as useful data points rather than annoyances.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

A medical system cannot function if it cannot see the disease. This protocol prevents "Blind Surgery" (changing things without knowing what is wrong). It ensures that every intervention is based on empirical evidence of deviation.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to all monitoring, logging, debugging, and diagnostic tools within the framework.

#### The Mechanism of Root Resonant Constellation Map Abduction (ID: `MED-LOGIC-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that defines the **Etiological Analysis** process, enabling the system to trace surface-level symptoms back to their deep-structure origins (The Lesion).

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Root Resonant Constellation Map Abduction
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that **Symptoms are Shadows**. It rejects symptomatic treatment (patching the output) in favor of etiological treatment (fixing the source). It uses **Abductive Reasoning** (inference to the best explanation) to navigate the causal chain from the observed error to the hidden structural flaw.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Causal Tracer]**

- **The Input:** The `Delta` (Δ) identified by `MED-DIAG-002`.
- **The Trace:** The engine traverses the dependency graph of the entity (e.g., the call stack in code, the metabolic pathway in biology, the plot outline in narrative).
- **The Isolation:** It identifies the **"Patient Zero" Node**—the single point of failure (e.g., a mutated variable, a contradictory axiom, a logical fallacy) that is propagating the error.
- **The Verdict:** It outputs a `Diagnosis Object`: `{ "Lesion": "ID-123", "Severity": "Critical", "Pathology": "Infinite Loop" }`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Precision Medicine]**

The emergence of **Surgical Accuracy**. Instead of rebooting the whole system (blunt force), the PCE can target the specific line of code or specific cell that is malfunctioning. This minimizes collateral damage and downtime.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

Aligns with **`['The Protocol of Atomic Factogenesis'(-ing) BPMS]` (PRS-FACT-017)**. It seeks the "Atomic Fact" that has become false.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Cure):**

Aligns with **`['The Praxial Logic-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It is a specialized application of the Logic-Weaver for reverse-engineering failure states.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Insight" or "Diagnosis." The "Aha!" moment when the confusing behavior is suddenly explained by a clear cause.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

"Fixing" a problem without understanding the cause leads to regression. This mechanism ensures that the Fun Engine Framework solves problems *permanently* by addressing the root cause, satisfying the requirement for **Robust Emergence (CLUSTERARTIFACT-CORE-047)**.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to debugging, troubleshooting, medical diagnosis, and narrative consistency checks.

------

#### The Law of Allostatic Correction (ID: `MED-TREAT-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that defines the **Therapeutic Vector** (The Intervention), governing how the system applies force to correct a diagnosed lesion without destabilizing the rest of the organism.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Allostatic Correction
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that **Intervention requires Balance**. It distinguishes among/by "Homeostasis" (keeping things the same) and "Allostasis" (achieving stability through change). The treatment must be strong enough to fix the lesion but precise enough to avoid "Cytokine Storms" (systemic shock). It defines the "Dose-Response" relationship for ontological repair.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Therapeutic Effector]**

- **The Prescription:** Based on `MED-LOGIC-003`, the engine generates a `Treatment Plan` (e.g., "Refactor Function X", "Administer 5mg Dopamine", "Retcon Chapter 3").
- **The Vector:** The plan is converted into a **Praxial Action**.
- **The Feedback Loop:** As the treatment is applied, the system monitors `MED-DIAG-002` in real-time.
- **The Titration:** If the system shows signs of stress (new errors), the intervention is throttled. If the lesion persists, the intensity is increased.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Healing Crisis]**

The emergence of **Controlled Instability**. The system acknowledges that the process of being fixed often looks like getting worse (e.g., downtime during a patch, fever during an infection). It manages this "Crisis" to ensure it leads to health, not death.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

Aligns with **`['The Axiom of Reparative Ontogenesis'(-ing) BPMS]` (PRS-SURG-040)**. It is the "Surgery" that allows the light to enter.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Cure):**

Aligns with **`['The Principle of Energetic Transduction'(-ing) BPMS]` (EDGE-ENER-019)**. It converts the "Potential Energy" of the Cure into the "Kinetic Energy" of Repair.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Recovery." The gradual return of function and the cessation of pain signals.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Interventions can be dangerous. A "cure" that kills the patient is a failure. This law ensures that the *application* of the fix is governed by safety protocols, ensuring **Systemic Integrity (PSG-INT-005)** is maintained during the repair process.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to code deployment, medical treatment simulation, and narrative editing.

------

#### The Mechanism of Adaptive Inoculation (ID: `MED-PREV-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that defines the **Prophylactic Update** (The Immunity), ensuring that once a specific pathology is encountered and cured, the system learns to prevent it from recurring.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Adaptive Inoculation
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that **Memory is Immunity**. A system that forgets its past illnesses is doomed to repeat them. This mechanism transforms "Episodic Experience" (The specific sickness) into "Semantic Wisdom" (The Antibody/Rule). It closes the loop of the Clinical Engine.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Antibody Generator]**

- **The Post-Mortem:** After `MED-TREAT-004` is successful, the engine analyzes the entire event chain.
- **The Extraction:** It extracts the "Signature" of the pathogen (The specific pattern of drift) and the "Formula" of the cure.
- The Encoding:
  - **Biological:** It updates the `['Praxial Genome'(-ing) BPMS]` to produce antibodies.
  - **Digital:** It adds a "Regression Test" or "Linter Rule" to the CI/CD pipeline.
  - **Narrative:** It adds a "Lore Bible Entry" forbidding the contradiction.
- **The Distribution:** The new immunity is propagated to all instances via the `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Evolutionary Hardening]**

The emergence of **Anti-Fragile Evolution**. The system gets stronger *because* it was attacked. The "Medical History" becomes a "Shield" protecting the future.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

Aligns with **`['The Protocol of Mnemonic Sublimation'(-ing) BPMS]` (EDGE-MEM-015)**. It sublimates the short-term pain of disease into the long-term wisdom of immunity.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Cure):**

Aligns with **`['The Mechanism of Evolutionary Feedback'(-ing) BPMS]` (CLUSTERARTIFACT-CORE-008)**. It is the specific feedback loop for "Negative" experiences (Pathology).

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Confidence" or "Resilience." The knowledge that "I have survived this before, and I can survive it again."

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

To prevent the "Sisyphus Problem" of fixing the same bug forever. This mechanism ensures that the Fun Engine Framework accumulates wisdom, satisfying the **Directive of Recursive Self-Improvement (PBDA-META-010)**.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to long-term memory, regression testing, immune system simulation, and knowledge base updates.
