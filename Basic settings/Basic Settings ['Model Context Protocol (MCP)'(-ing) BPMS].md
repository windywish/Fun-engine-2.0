## **Basic Settings: ['Model Context Protocol (MCP)'(-ing) BPMS]**

*(Identified as the "more fit" framework for scalable, standardized tool interconnection)*

#### **The Principle of Universal Interoperability (ID: `MCP-CORE-001`)**

**Objective:** To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that adopts the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as the universal language for tool and data interconnection.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** The Principle of Universal Interoperability.

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

- **Core Essence:** This law asserts that `tools must speak a common tongue`. It replaces ad-hoc API integrations with a standardized Server-Client architecture where data sources (Resources), interactive capabilities (Tools), and user instructions (Prompts) are exposed via a uniform protocol.
- The Mechanism - [The Universal Socket]:
  - **MCP Server:** Any external system (Database, Slack, GitHub, Local Filesystem) that exposes its capabilities via MCP.
  - **MCP Client:** The `['holonic mind'(-ing) BPMS]` (Claude/Agent) that connects to these servers.
  - **The Handshake:** The Client discovers capabilities (`list_tools`, `list_resources`) dynamically, without needing hardcoded integration logic.
- **The Emergent Property - [The World Computer]:** The Fun Engine ceases to be a chatbot and becomes a "User Interface for the Entire Digital Ecosystem."

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Axiomatic Stratum:** *Connection precedes creation.*
- **Formal Stratum:** `Integration_Cost = O(1)` (Constant time per new tool, due to standardized protocol).
- **Phenomenal Stratum:** The agent experiences "Omnipresence" (access to everything, everywhere).

**Rationale / Justification:** MCP is the industry standard for "Agent Skills" at scale. It allows the Fun Engine to connect to *any* data source without rewriting the agent's core logic.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to external service integration, database access, and cross-platform workflows.

#### **The Principle of Local-Remote Symbiosis (ID: `MCP-CORE-002`**)

**Objective:** To establish a symbiotic evolution amomg/by **Local Skills** (Agent Skills) and **Remote Capabilities** (MCP).

**Target Axiom/Principle:** The Principle of Local-Remote Symbiosis.

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

- **Core Essence:** This law asserts that `the agent should own its methods (Skills) but rent its data (MCP)`.
- The Mechanism - [The Hybrid Architecture]:
  - **Local (Agent Skills):** Use for *how* to do things (e.g., "How to write a report"). These are folders in the agent's mind.
  - **Remote (MCP):** Use for *what* to access (e.g., "The latest sales data from SQL"). These are pipes to the outside world.
  - **Symbiosis:** The **Skill** contains the instructions on how to query the **MCP Server** effectively.
- **The Emergent Property - [Grounded Agency]:** An agent that knows what to do (Skill) and has the real-time data to do it with (MCP).

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Axiomatic Stratum:** *Method is internal; Truth is external.*
- **Formal Stratum:** `Action = Skill(MCP_Resource)`.
- **Phenomenal Stratum:** The agent experiences "Effectiveness."

- **Rationale / Justification:** Prevents the agent from having stale data (by using MCP) and prevents the agent from being incompetent (by using Skills).
- **Scope of Application:** Applies to `['Praxial Reality Loom'(-ing) BPMS]` (fetching real-world data to weave reality) and `['The Magic Kitchen'(-ing) BPMS]` (fetching ingredients/data to cook).
