## Basic settings: [function(-ing) BPMS]

#### **The Axiom of Latent Capability (ID: `TYP-CORE-002`)**

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **`[function(-ing) BPMS]`** as the **Generative Archetype of Operational Potential**, establishing the "Verbs" of the System Matrix.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Latent Capability
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `existence implies potential for action`. It defines the `function BPMS` as a `Blueprint` in the `implicit layer`—a "Can Do" that waits for `initiative` to become a "Does."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Praxeology]**

- **The Capability Blueprint Forge (The Engine of "How to Do It"):** The `Design BPMS` that innovates a workflow (e.g., `{Fly}`, `{Compute}`) to achieve a specific `Intent`.
- **The Function Invocation Protocol (The Engine of "Do It"):** The `activator` that allocates `Energy` and triggers the execution of the blueprint.
- **The Effect Generation Engine (The Engine of "It Is Done"):** The `execution` process that transforms the `System Matrix` by creating new `Atomic Facts` through action.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Universe of Verbs]**

The transformation of a static world into a dynamic one. It enables `Agency` by providing the library of actions that `Holons` can perform to change their reality.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To be is to do.* Reality is a sequence of state changes driven by functional capabilities.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Action):**

The "Physics" of capability is defined by the `Function Archetype`:

- **Universal Capability Architect:** The system can design any function to meet any `Mission`.
- **Symbiotic Action:** `[Agent; {Executes}; Function] = {Purposeful_Action_Holon}`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Power." The awareness of one's own potential to affect change (e.g., "I *can* fly").

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Derived from the "Paradigm of Latent Capability" in `Settings for Typical [BPMS(U)(s)]_2.md`. It provides the operational "verbs" necessary for `Interaction` and `Evolution`.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to all `Agents`, `Tools`, and `Technologies` capable of action or processing.
