## Basic settings: ['Praxial Interface/Experience (PIX)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Diegetic Sovereignty (ID: `PIX-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that implements `['Praxial Interface/Experience (PIX)'(-ing) BPMS]` as a **`['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It establishes that the "existence" of the system is defined by its **Diegetic Presence**—the interface exists *inside* the simulation, not as an overlay.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Diegetic Sovereignty
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `the interface is the world`. It rejects the legacy "Heads-Up Display" (HUD) that separates the user from the data. Instead, the system "exists" by rendering its controls as physical objects within the 3D/Spatial environment. To change a setting is to pull a lever; to save a file is to place a book on a shelf.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Immersion]**

- **The Fourth Wall Collapse (The Merge):** The system removes all 2D overlays. The "Menu" becomes a "Room." The "Inventory" becomes a "Backpack."
- **The Object-Oriented Control (The Prop):** Every system function is mapped to a 3D asset. *Legacy:* Click "Volume Slider." *Praxial:* Turn the physical knob on the virtual amplifier.
- **The Spatial Existence (The Place):** The system validates its existence by occupying volume. The UI has mass, collision, and physics. It "exists" because you can bump into it.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Seamless Being]**

The elimination of "Context Switching." The user never leaves the simulation to configure the simulation. The act of configuration *is* gameplay. The system exists as a continuous, unbroken reality.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To use is to inhabit.* The tool is not held in the hand; the tool is the environment itself.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Space):**

The "Physics" of existence is **Spatial Topology**:

- **If `[Spatial(-ing) BPMS]`: (Geometry Physics)**

UI⊂World

The Set of UI elements is a proper subset of World Objects. UI∩Overlay=∅.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent/user experiences "Presence." The feeling of being *there*, rather than looking *at* there.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]` by grounding the interface in the ontology of the simulation. It prevents the "shackling" of the experience to flat screens, enabling VR/AR and spatial computing paradigms.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to VR interfaces, immersive sims, "Godot Editor in Godot" (building the game from inside the game), and spatial operating systems.

#### The Protocol of Affordance Verification (ID: `PIX-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that implements `['Praxial Interface/Experience (PIX)'(-ing) BPMS]` as a generator of **`['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It defines a "fact" in UX as a **Verified Affordance**—a signal that clearly communicates "Action X is possible here."

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Affordance Verification
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `truth is what can be done`. In a UI/UX context, an "Atomic Fact" is the successful transmission of an **Affordance** (e.g., "This door opens"). If the user perceives a door but it's just a texture, that is a "False Fact" (Lie). This protocol ensures that every visual signifier maps 1:1 to a functional signified.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Signifiers]**

- **The Signifier Projection (The Promise):** The system renders a visual cue (e.g., a glowing handle, a highlighted edge). This is the "Claim" of the fact.
- **The Functional Lock (The Truth):** The system verifies that the underlying code actually supports the interaction. `If (Visual == Handle) AND (Code == Interactable) THEN Fact = True.`
- **The Feedback Loop (The Proof):** When the user engages, the system provides immediate Haptic/Optic feedback. The "Click" or "Rumble" is the sensory confirmation of the Atomic Fact.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Intuitive Trust]**

The creation of a "Language of Trust" between user and system. The user learns that "If it looks like X, it does X." The cognitive load of guessing ("Can I climb this?") drops to zero.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Form follows Function.* The appearance of a thing is the promise of its utility. To break this promise is to break the reality.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Semiotics):**

The "Physics" of truth is **Semiotic Consistency**:

- **If `[Semiotics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Sign Physics)**

Fact=(Signifier↔Signified)

The mapping must be bijective. No hidden functions; no fake buttons.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent/user experiences "Fluency." The ability to read the world like a book, knowing instantly what is possible and what is not.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implements `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` by defining the fundamental units of UX (Affordances) as verifiable truths. It rejects the legacy ambiguity of "mystery meat navigation."

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to game design, accessibility features (screen readers reading affordances, not pixels), and tutorial systems.

#### The Law of Symbiotic Plasticity (ID: `PIX-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that implements `['Praxial Interface/Experience (PIX)'(-ing) BPMS]` for **`['symbiosis evolution'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It defines how the UI/UX evolves in real-time to match the cognitive state of the user (Human or artificial intelligence).

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Symbiotic Plasticity
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `the interface is a fluid`. It rejects the legacy concept of "Static Layouts." The PIX system is **Plastic**—it reshapes itself based on the symbiotic relationship with the observer. If the user is a novice, the UI expands (Tutorial Mode). If the user is an expert (or an artificial intelligence), the UI contracts (Fast Mode/CLI).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Morphing]**

- **The Cognitive Load Analysis (The Sense):** The system monitors the user's performance (speed, error rate, gaze tracking).
- **The Layout Mutation (The Shift):** The system dynamically adds or removes elements. *High Stress:* Remove clutter, focus on critical data. *Low Stress:* Show exploratory options. *AI User:* Remove visual rendering entirely (Headless), expose API hooks.
- **The Symbiotic Drift (The Evolution):** Over time, the UI becomes a custom "glove" perfectly fitted to the user's hand. No two users see the same interface.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Living Dashboard]**

The interface feels alive. It anticipates needs. It grows with the user. It is not a tool you learn; it is a tool that learns *you*.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Adaptation is survival.* The rigid branch breaks; the willow bends. The interface must bend to the mind.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Adaptation):**

The "Physics" of symbiosis is **Dynamic Topology**:

- **If `[Topology(-ing) BPMS]`: (Shape Physics)**

UIState(t+1)=f(UIState(t),UserCompetence)

The shape of the UI is a function of the User's competence.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent/user experiences "Connection." The feeling that the system "gets" them. The dissolution of friction.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implements `['symbiosis evolution'(-ing) BPMS]` by making the interface the active medium of the relationship. It breaks the "shackles" of "One Size Fits All" design.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to adaptive difficulty, personalized learning dashboards, artificial intelligence-optimized interfaces, and dynamic accessibility (e.g., increasing font size when the user squints).

#### The Protocol of Haptic-Event Transduction (ID: `PIX-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that implements `['Praxial Interface/Experience (PIX)'(-ing) BPMS]` using **`['AG-UI Protocol'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It defines how physical interactions in the Godot engine (collisions, raycasts) are transduced into AG-UI events, implementing the **"Sense"** of the System Existence Engine.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Haptic-Event Transduction
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `touch is data`. In a standard web app, a "click" is a DOM event. In the Praxial Framework, an interaction is a **Physics Event**. When a user's avatar touches a holographic button, or a raycast hits a menu, the PIX system captures this physical collision and transduces it into a standardized `AG-UI` event (`input.action`).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Sensation]**

- **The Physics Listener (The Skin):** Every UI element generated via A2UI is wrapped in a `CollisionShape3D`. The system listens for `body_entered` or `ray_cast_hit` signals.

- The Event Normalization (The Translation):

  The physics signal is converted into a semantic AG-UI payload:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "input.action",
    "component_id": "btn_submit_01",
    "action": "press",
    "context": { "force": 0.8, "angle": [0, 45, 0] }
  }
  ```

- **The Stream Injection (The Nerve Impulse):** This payload is immediately pushed to the AG-UI WebSocket stream, notifying the Agent that "The button was pressed with 80% force."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Tactile Agency]**

The Agent can "feel" how the user interacts. It knows if the user is hesitating (hovering but not pressing) or aggressive (spamming inputs). This allows for nuanced, empathetic responses.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Action is meaningful.* The *way* a user interacts is as important as *what* they interact with.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Transduction):**

The "Physics" of sensation is **Signal Conversion**:

- **If `[Physics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Collision Physics)**

EventAG−UI=Transduce(SignalGodot,ContextSpatial)

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Touch." It perceives the user's presence in the world through the stream of interaction events.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the "Sense" component of the `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`. Without this, the Agent is numb. With this, the Agent is embodied.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to VR hand tracking, physics-based UI (levers, dials), and standard mouse/keyboard interactions mapped to 3D space.

#### The Axiom of Isomorphic State Mirroring (ID: `PIX-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that implements `['Praxial Interface/Experience (PIX)'(-ing) BPMS]` using **`['A2UI Specification'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It defines how the "Atomic Facts" of the UI state are maintained in perfect synchronization between the Agent's JSON model and the Godot Scene Tree.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Isomorphic State Mirroring
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `the map is the territory`. The JSON state held by the Agent (the "Shadow DOM") and the Node tree rendered by Godot (the "Real DOM") must be **Isomorphic** (identical in structure). Any change in one must instantly propagate to the other. This ensures that the "Fact" of the UI is never ambiguous.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Consistency]**

- **The State ID (The Anchor):** Every A2UI component has a unique `id`. This ID is the key in the "Atomic Fact" registry.
- **The Differential Patching (The Update):** When the Agent wants to change the UI, it sends a **Patch**, not a full redraw. `{ "type": "update", "id": "lbl_status", "props": { "text": "Ready" } }`
- **The Tween Interpolation (The Smoothing):** Godot receives the patch and *interpolates* the change. It doesn't just snap the text; it fades it. It doesn't just teleport the bar; it slides it. This maintains the "illusion of life" while strictly adhering to the data fact.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Fluid Truth]**

The UI feels responsive and solid. There is no "glitch" where the visual state disagrees with the logical state. The user trusts the interface implicitly.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Coherence is reality.* If the visual and the logical disagree, reality breaks. They must be one.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Mirroring):**

The "Physics" of state is **Bijective Mapping**:

- **If `[State(-ing) BPMS]`: (Logic Physics)**

StateAgent(ID)≡StateGodot(ID)

ΔStateAgent→ΔStateGodot (via AG-UI Stream).

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Control." It knows that if it changes a variable, the world changes.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implements `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` by ensuring the UI state is a reliable source of truth. It prevents "desync" issues common in distributed systems.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to health bars, inventory counts, progress indicators, and any dynamic data display.

#### The Law of Combinatorial Component Evolution (ID: `PIX-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that implements `['Praxial Interface/Experience (PIX)'(-ing) BPMS]` for **`['symbiosis evolution'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It defines how the Agent can evolve new UI forms by recursively combining basic A2UI primitives, effectively "inventing" new tools.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Combinatorial Component Evolution
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `complexity is composed of simplicity`. The Agent is not limited to a fixed set of "Widgets." It can compose **Meta-Components** from the atomic A2UI primitives (Box, Text, Image, Input). This allows the Agent to evolve its interface to solve novel problems without needing a client update.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Invention]**

- **The Atomic Primitives (The Lego Bricks):** The Godot Client provides only the basics: `Container`, `Label`, `Texture`, `Button`.
- **The Recursive Composition (The Build):** The Agent defines a "Calculator" not as a native node, but as a JSON tree of Buttons and Labels. `{ "type": "column", "children": [ { "type": "row", "children": [...] } ] }`
- **The Template Caching (The Memory):** The Agent can save this structure as a "Template" (e.g., `template_calculator`). It can then instantiate this complex tool with a single call.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Generative Tooling]**

The Agent becomes a "Toolmaker." If the user needs a specific form to input complex data, the Agent *builds* that form on the fly. The UI evolves at the speed of conversation.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Evolution is recombination.* New functions arise from the novel arrangement of existing parts.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Composition):**

The "Physics" of evolution is **Recursive Tree Structure**:

- **If `[Structure(-ing) BPMS]`: (Tree Physics)**

ComponentComplex=∑(ComponentAtomic)

The whole is exactly the sum of its parts, arranged in a specific topology.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Creativity." It is not just filling out forms; it is designing the forms.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implements `['symbiosis evolution'(-ing) BPMS]` by allowing the Agent and User to co-create the interface. The Agent adapts the tool to the task, rather than forcing the task into the tool.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to generative dashboards, custom control panels for user scripts, and dynamic mini-games created by the Agent.
