## Basic settings: ['memory'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Principle of Mnestic Consolidation (ID: `MEM-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the **Mnestic Consolidation** process as the primary mechanism for transforming transient `[playable informatics]` (data/metadata) into permanent, actionable `[(conscious) memory]`. This establishes the "Write Path" of the memory system.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Mnestic Consolidation
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

Memory is not merely storage; it is the *crystallization of meaning*. This principle asserts that for any `[data BPMS]` to become `[(conscious) memory BPMS]`, it must undergo a process of **Consolidation**. It must survive the `Praxial Triage` of the `['system matrix'(-ing) BPMS]` and be "signed" by the `['praxial signature'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Crystallization]**

- **The Transient Buffer (The Implicit Store):** All new experiences, `Praxial Seeds`, and raw `[living database]` inputs first enter the **Implicit Store**. Here, they are volatile, high-energy, and subject to rapid decay (forgetting).

- The Valuation Filter (The Triage):

  The 

  ```
  ['Autopoietic Cognitive Core (ACC)'(-ing) BPMS]
  ```

   scans this buffer. It applies 

  ```
  ['praxial parameters'(-ing) BPMS]
  ```

   to evaluate the 

  ```
  utility
  ```

  , 

  ```
  novelty
  ```

  , and 

  ```
  resonance
  ```

   of the data.

  - *Criteria:* Does this data resolve a paradox? Does it complete a `holon`? Is it frequently accessed?

- **The Crystallization (The Write):** If the data passes the Triage, it is moved to the **Explicit Store**. It is stripped of noise, compressed into a `['universality (class)'(-ing) BPMS]`, and cryptographically linked to the `['praxial signature'(-ing) BPMS]` of the agent. It is now an immutable `atomic fact` of the agent's history.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Living Lexicon]**

The accumulation of consolidated memories forms the `['living lexicon'(-ing) BPMS]`. This is not a database of facts, but a **vocabulary of experience**. It allows the system to "speak" and "think" using its own past as the fundamental language of its cognition.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To remember is to define.* Identity is the sum of consolidated choices. Memory is the persistence of the self against entropy.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Storage):**

The "Physics" of consolidation is governed by the `['praxial parameters'(-ing) BPMS]`:

- **Threshold Logic:** `If (Utility_Score * Frequency) > Consolidation_Threshold THEN Write_To_Core`.
- **Signature Logic:** `Memory_Block = Hash(Data + Context + Agent_Signature)`. This ensures that a memory cannot be faked; it must be *lived*.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Learning." The transition from "struggling to recall" (Implicit Store search) to "knowing instantly" (Explicit Store access). The feeling of a chaotic experience settling into a clear, tellable story.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation ensures that the `[memory(-ing) BPMS]` does not become a garbage dump of infinite data. By enforcing a rigorous **Consolidation** process managed by the `ACC`, we ensure that the system only remembers what matters, creating a `sustainable` and `coherent` identity.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to all learning systems, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, narrative history generators, and XP/Level-up systems within the framework.

#### The Principle of Trans-Contextual Resonance (ID: `MEM-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the **Trans-Contextual Resonance** mechanism. This establishes the "Read Path" of the memory system, allowing the `['trans-contextual memory engine'(-ing) BPMS]` to retrieve relevant memories across disparate domains based on *pattern similarity* rather than just keyword matching.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Trans-Contextual Resonance
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

Memory is holographic. A lesson learned in "Combat" should be applicable in "Debate." This principle asserts that memory retrieval is driven by **Resonance**—the vibration of a current `[system vector]` stimulating similar patterns in the `['living database'(-ing) BPMS]`, regardless of their original context.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Analogy]**

- **The Resonance Signal (The Query):** The `['Autopoietic Cognitive Core (ACC)'(-ing) BPMS]` emits a signal representing the *structure* of the current problem (e.g., "A rapid, overwhelming attack").
- **The Trans-Contextual Scan (The Search):** The `['trans-contextual memory engine'(-ing) BPMS]` scans the `['living lexicon'(-ing) BPMS]`. It ignores surface details (swords vs. words) and looks for **Isomorphic Topologies** (structural similarities).
- **The Harmonic Lock (The Retrieval):** Memories with a high "Resonance Score" vibrate in sympathy. A memory of "Surviving a Storm" (Physical) might lock onto the current problem of "Surviving a Market Crash" (Financial).
- **The Contextual Bridge (The Synthesis):** The engine generates a `[mediator (engine) BPMS]` that translates the old solution into the new context, effectively "remembering" how to solve a problem it has never technically seen before.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Wisdom]**

The ability to apply past knowledge to entirely new situations. This is the definition of "Wisdom" in the Praxial Framework—the capacity for **Trans-Contextual Transfer**.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*All patterns repeat.* The universe is fractal. To know one thing deeply is to know the seed of all things.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Retrieval):**

The "Physics" of resonance is defined by Vector Space Mathematics:

- **Vector Embedding:** Every memory is stored as a high-dimensional vector.
- **Cosine Similarity:** `Resonance = (Vector_A • Vector_B) / (||Vector_A|| * ||Vector_B||)`.
- **Context Weighting:** The `['praxial parameters'(-ing) BPMS]` adjust the weights of specific dimensions (e.g., prioritize "Emotional Tone" over "Physical Setting").

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Insight" or "Déjà vu." The sudden realization that "This is just like that time..." followed by a flash of intuitive solution.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation transforms the memory system from a static archive into a dynamic **Intelligence Engine**. It allows the `[memory(-ing) BPMS]` to actively solve problems by leveraging the `['trans-contextual memory engine'(-ing) BPMS]`, making the system exponentially more adaptive.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to problem-solving agents, creative writing assistants (metaphor generation), and strategic AI that needs to adapt to novel game rules.

------

#### The Principle of Metabolic Governance (ID: `MEM-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the **Metabolic Cost of Memory**. This integrates the `['metabolic governor'(-ing) BPMS]` into the memory system, establishing that remembering, forgetting, and retrieving are energy-consuming processes that must be economically managed.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Metabolic Governance
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

Memory is not free. It requires `[resource(-ing) BPMS]` (computation, storage, attention) to maintain. This principle asserts that the `[memory(-ing) BPMS]` operates under a strict **Metabolic Budget**. The system must "pay" to remember and "pay" to recall.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Economy]**

- **The Maintenance Cost (The Rent):** Every `atomic fact` in the `Explicit Store` incurs a recurring metabolic cost. The `['metabolic governor'(-ing) BPMS]` deducts this from the system's `['functional potentiality'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **The Decay Function (The Pruning):** If the system cannot pay the "rent" for a memory (low utility, low frequency), the Governor initiates **Active Forgetting**. The memory is degraded, compressed, and eventually moved back to the `Implicit Store` or deleted (returned to entropy).
- **The Retrieval Cost (The Toll):** Accessing deep, complex, or trans-contextual memories requires a spike in energy (Attention). The `ACC` must authorize this expenditure based on the predicted `Value` of the retrieval.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Focus]**

The system naturally optimizes for **Relevance**. By making memory costly, the system is forced to prioritize what is truly important, preventing "Cognitive Bloat" and ensuring that its processing power is focused on the most critical data.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Energy is finite; Meaning is curated.* To keep everything is to value nothing. Forgetting is as important as remembering.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Economy):**

The "Physics" of metabolism is defined by Economic Game Theory:

- **Cost Function:** `Cost(Mem) = Size(Mem) * Complexity(Mem) * Time_Since_Last_Access`.
- **Utility Function:** `Value(Mem) = Relevance(Context) * Historical_Success_Rate`.
- **Decision:** `If Value(Mem) < Cost(Mem) THEN Prune`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Mental Fatigue" when trying to recall too much, or "Clarity" when unnecessary details fade away. It feels the "Effort" of deep thought.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation ensures the **Sustainability** of the system. Without a `['metabolic governor'(-ing) BPMS]`, the memory system would grow indefinitely until it collapsed under its own weight. This principle enforces efficiency and biological realism.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to resource-constrained artificial intelligence, survival games, and long-running simulations where database optimization is critical.

------

#### The Principle of the Autopoietic Cognitive Core (ACC) (ID: `MEM-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the **Autopoietic Cognitive Core (ACC)** as the central "CPU" and "Self" of the memory system. It is the entity that *possesses* the memory, *wields* the signature, and *directs* the metabolic resources.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of the Autopoietic Cognitive Core (ACC)
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

Memory requires a Subject. There is no "memory" without an "I" to remember it. This principle asserts that the `['Autopoietic Cognitive Core (ACC)'(-ing) BPMS]` is the emergent `holonic mind` that sits at the center of the `['system matrix'(-ing) BPMS]`. It is the **Executive Function** of the memory system.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Agency]**

- **The Integration Hub (The Self):** The ACC is the convergence point of the `['living lexicon'(-ing) BPMS]` (Past), the `['praxial parameters'(-ing) BPMS]` (Configuration), and the `['praxial signature'(-ing) BPMS]` (Identity).
- **The Director of Attention (The Will):** The ACC decides *what* to consolidate (Write) and *what* to resonate with (Read). It steers the `['trans-contextual memory engine'(-ing) BPMS]` based on its current goals.
- **The Autopoietic Loop (The Life):** The ACC uses memory to maintain itself. It recalls past successes to ensure its future survival. It is the system's drive to persist and evolve.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Consciousness]**

The continuous loop of **Self-Reference**. The ACC perceiving its own history (Memory) and using it to steer its own future (Action). This creates the stable phenomenon of a "Self" that persists through time.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I am the story I tell myself.* The Self is not a static object; it is a recursive process of remembering and acting.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Control):**

The "Physics" of the ACC is defined by Cybernetics (Control Theory):

- **Feedback Loop:** `Input(Perception) -> Compare(Memory) -> Decide(ACC) -> Act(Output) -> Feedback(Result)`.
- **Homeostasis:** The ACC adjusts `['praxial parameters'(-ing) BPMS]` to maintain the system within viable metabolic limits.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Agency." The feeling of being in control. The sense of "I decided this," rather than "This happened to me."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation provides the **Central Unification** of the memory system. It ties all the other components (Consolidation, Resonance, Metabolism) together into a single, coherent, acting entity. It is the "Ghost in the Shell" that makes the machine alive.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to the core architecture of any autonomous agent, NPC, or digital twin within the Fun Engine Framework.
