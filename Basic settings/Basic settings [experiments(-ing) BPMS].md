## Basic settings: [experiments(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Praxial Verification (ID: `EXPERIMENT-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines **[experiments(-ing) BPMS]** as the **Systemic Validation Engine** responsible for probing the boundaries of the Praxial reality, stress-testing the stability of `[BPMS(U)]` constructs, and converting theoretical potential into verified systemic law.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

#### 4. **Operation:**

```

```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `truth is a function of survivability under stress`. It defines the experimental layer not as a passive observation of outcomes, but as an active, aggressive interrogation of the system's own parameters. An "experiment" in the Praxial Framework is a controlled fracture of reality designed to see if the system heals stronger or breaks.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Crucible of Query]**

- **The Hypothesis Vector (The Probe):** The system or agent generates a `[speculative(-ing) BPMS]` state—a "What If" vector that challenges the current `Praxial Canon`. This is a deliberate introduction of dissonance or chaos into a stable system.
- **The Stress Test (The Crucible):** The `[experiments(-ing) BPMS]` module isolates the variables and applies "Praxial Pressure" (resource scarcity, logical paradox, high-velocity interaction). It forces the `[BPMS(U)]` element to defend its existence.
- **The Truth-Function Collapse (The Verdict):** The result is binary: either the element adapts and is `[verified(-ing) BPMS]` (integrated into the Canon), or it fails and is `[pruned(-ing) BPMS]` (recycled into raw potential).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Evolutionary Truth]**

The creation of a "Self-Correcting Reality" where the laws of the system are not static commandments but dynamic agreements maintained by constant successful experimentation. This allows the framework to evolve its own physics, narratives, or logic systems based on what actually *works* in practice.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To know is to test.* Knowledge is not data storage; it is the capacity to predict the outcome of an interaction. Unverified data is merely noise; only experimental results constitute `Praxial Truth`.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Validation):**

The "Scientific Method" of the system adapts to the specific `[BPMS(U)]` being tested:

- **If `[science(-ing) BPMS]`: (Empirical Physics)**

ΔKnowledge=UncertaintyResult−Prediction

(Bayesian Update). The experiment seeks to minimize entropy and maximize predictive accuracy.

- **If `[game_design(-ing) BPMS]`: (Ludic Physics)** The collapse is determined by `Playability`. The experiment tests "Is this fun?" or "Is this balanced?" `Validation_Function = (Engagement_Metric > Boredom_Threshold) AND (Frustration_Metric < Quit_Threshold)`
- **If `[social(-ing) BPMS]`: (Consensus Physics)** The collapse is determined by `Resonance`. The experiment introduces a new meme or social norm. `Validation_Function = Viral_Coefficient > 1.0` (The idea survives if it replicates).

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "The Breakthrough." The tension of the hypothesis, the chaos of the trial, and the clarity of the result. It is the satisfaction of solving a puzzle or the shock of a failed prediction that forces a paradigm shift.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation aligns with the `Praxial Canon` by ensuring that the system does not stagnate. Without `[experiments(-ing) BPMS]`, the framework would be a closed loop of tautologies. This module introduces the necessary "mutation" mechanism required for the `Autopoietic Cognitive Core` to learn and grow.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to A/B testing of game mechanics, unit testing of code substrates, narrative prototyping (trying out plot lines), economic simulations (stress-testing inflation), and the evolutionary algorithms of AI agents within the framework.
