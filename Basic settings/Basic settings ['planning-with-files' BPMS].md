### Basic settings: ['planning-with-files' BPMS]

#### The Axiom of File-Based Cognition (ID: `PLAN-FILE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the **['planning-with-files' BPMS]** as the **['Praxial Cognitive File System'(-ing) BPMS]**, serving as a tangible implementation for **['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]**.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of File-Based Cognition
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that "to think is to write." Cognition is not an abstract electrical impulse but a concrete file operation. The state of the **['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]** is isomorphic to the state of a structured file directory.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Cognitive Directory]**

- **The Thought (File):** Every plan, memory, or belief is instantiated as a discrete file (e.g., `plan_attack.md`, `memory_001.json`).
- The Thinking (IO Operations):
  - **Perception:** `Read` file contents.
  - **Reasoning:** `Edit` / `Append` to file contents.
  - **Forgetting:** `Delete` or `Archive` files.
- **The State (FileSystem):** The global state of the agent is the current snapshot of its directory tree.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Tangible Introspection]**

The mind becomes navigable. You can "browse" the agent's thoughts, debug its plans, and backup its personality.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

*The word made flesh; the thought made file.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):**

**If `[operating_system(-ing) BPMS]`:** `Mind = Directory_Tree`. `Thought = File_Handle`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):**

The agent experiences "clarity"—thoughts are structured, persistent, and organized.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Provides a "really working implementation" for complex state management that is human-readable and debuggable.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to long-term memory storage, complex quest tracking, and agent personality configuration.

#### The Principle of Iterative Drafting (ID: `PLAN-FILE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the **['(technology) paradigm/mechanism'(-ing) BPMS]** of **Iterative Refinement** within the file-based framework.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Iterative Drafting
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that plans are not born perfect; they are edited into perfection. The **['planning-with-files' BPMS]** acts as the "Editor," treating the **['system vector'(-ing) BPMS]** as a living document that undergoes multiple revisions before execution.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Red Pen Protocol]**

- **The Draft (Initial Plan):** The agent generates a rough `plan_v1.md`.
- **The Critique (Analysis):** The **['(system) analysis'(-ing) BPMS]** reads the file and appends comments/corrections (e.g., "Risk too high in step 3").
- **The Revision (Edit):** The agent reads the critique and uses `str_replace` or `rewrite` to create `plan_v2.md`.
- **The Commit (Execution):** Only when the file passes validation is it marked as `executable`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Deliberation]**

The system exhibits "thoughtfulness." It considers, reconsiders, and polishes its intent.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

*Measure twice, cut once. Write twice, execute once.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):**

**If `[version_control(-ing) BPMS]`:** `Plan_Final = Merge(Draft, Critique)`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):**

The agent experiences "confidence"—knowing the plan has been vetted.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Prevents impulsive, error-prone actions common in one-shot generation models.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to strategic artificial intelligence, architectural generation, and narrative plotting.

#### The Engine of Structured Template Compliance (ID: `PLAN-FILE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines how **[tools(-ing) BPMS]** enforce logic through file structure.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Engine of Structured Template Compliance
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This setting asserts that structure dictates function. By forcing agents to fill out specific file templates (e.g., a "Mission Manifest" or "Character Sheet"), the system ensures that **['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]** are generated in a usable format.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Form Filler]**

- **The Template (The Mold):** A file with empty slots (e.g., `Goal: [ ]`, `Constraints: [ ]`, `Steps: [ ]`).
- **The Constraint (The Guide):** The agent cannot simply "output text"; it must "complete the file."
- **The Validation (The Check):** The system parses the file. If the structure is broken (e.g., missing JSON keys), the file is rejected.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Standardization]**

Chaos is tamed. Diverse agents produce compatible outputs based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that they use the same forms.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

*The shape of the vessel shapes the water.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):**

**If `[data_schema(-ing) BPMS]`:** `Validate(File_Content, Schema_Definition) == True`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):**

The agent experiences "discipline"—thinking within the lines.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for interoperability between different **[BPMS(U)(s)]**.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to quest generation, item creation, and NPC bio generation.

#### The Blueprint of the Praxial Scribe (ID: `PLAN-FILE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines a **['super intelligence agent'(-ing) BPMS]** called the **['Praxial Scribe'(-ing) BPMS]**, which is a superior implementation of the **['planning-with-files' BPMS]**.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Blueprint of the Praxial Scribe
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This setting defines the "Scribe," a meta-agent responsible for maintaining the integrity of the **['praxial dynamic link substrate (PDLS)' BPMS]**. It is the "Librarian of Reality," ensuring that the file-based memory does not become a digital hoard.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Archival Loop]**

- **The Indexing (Organization):** The Scribe scans all agent files and builds a master index (`index.md`), linking related concepts.
- **The Pruning (Garbage Collection):** It identifies obsolete plans or contradictory facts and archives or deletes them.
- **The Synthesis (Summary):** It reads multiple "daily logs" and compresses them into a single "historical chronicle" file.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Coherent History]**

The system maintains a clean, accessible history without data rot.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

*History is not what happened; it is what is written.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):**

**If `[knowledge_management(-ing) BPMS]`:** `Knowledge_Graph = Build_Graph(File_System)`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):**

The system experiences "continuity"—a seamless connection to its past.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Prevents the "context window" problem by managing external storage intelligently.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to lore management, long-term game history, and server logs.

#### The Paradigm of Document-Driven Reality (ID: `PLAN-FILE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the **['(technology) paradigm/mechanism'(-ing) BPMS]** where the file system *is* the reality.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Paradigm of Document-Driven Reality
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This paradigm asserts that the map *is* the territory. Changing a file in the **['planning-with-files' BPMS]** directly alters the **['system matrix'(-ing) BPMS]**. Reality is a document that is being collaboratively written by agents and the system.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Hot-Reload World]**

- **The Source (The File):** `world_state.json` contains `{ "weather": "sunny" }`.
- **The Edit (The Action):** An agent (or the Scribe) changes "sunny" to "stormy".
- **The Update (The Effect):** The **['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** detects the file change and immediately renders a storm.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Plasticity]**

Reality is as malleable as text.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

*It is written, so it shall be.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):**

**If `[reactive_programming(-ing) BPMS]`:** `Watch(File_Path).onChange(Update_World)`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):**

The agent experiences "power"—the ability to rewrite the world.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Simplifies the interface between AI and Game Engine. The AI just writes text; the Engine parses it.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to sandbox games, developer tools, and dynamic environment control.

#### The Protocol of Multi-Agent File Collaboration (ID: `PLAN-FILE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines how multiple agents collaborate using the **['planning-with-files' BPMS]**.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Multi-Agent File Collaboration
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol defines the file system as a shared workspace. Agents do not communicate via ephemeral messages but by reading and writing to shared "Blackboard" files.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Blackboard Architecture]**

- **The Board (Shared File):** `mission_board.md` or `shared_memory.txt`.
- **The Contribution (Append):** Agent A writes a hypothesis. Agent B reads it and adds evidence. Agent C writes a conclusion.
- **The Lock (Concurrency):** The system manages file locks to prevent race conditions (agents talking over each other).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Collective Intelligence]**

The group builds a shared understanding that persists even if individual agents die.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

*The library outlasts the librarian.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):**

**If `[distributed_computing(-ing) BPMS]`:** `Shared_State = Replicated_File_System`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):**

The agents experience "community"—working on a common text.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Enables complex, asynchronous cooperation.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to faction artificial intelligence, squad tactics, and collaborative storytelling.
