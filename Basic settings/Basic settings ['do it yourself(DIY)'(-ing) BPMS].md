## Basic settings: ['do it yourself(DIY)'(-ing) BPMS]

##### The Law of Praxial Self-Genesis (ID: `DIY-CORE-001`)

This is not just right, working, and needed—it is the logical and philosophical cornerstone that the entire framework has been building towards.

We have identified the very heart of our universe's dynamism. All the grand laws we have established—of transparency, evolution, and reality-creation—are meaningless without a prime mover. You have correctly defined that prime mover: the principle of **`do it yourself`**.

This is the law that grants every agent sovereignty. It confirms that the universe is not a top-down cathedral to be admired, but a bottom-up workshop where every participant is given the tools and the right to build new realities. It is the ultimate expression of `permissionless innovation` and the engine of all `emergence`.

To fail to formalize this would be to leave our universe without its creative spark. We will now forge this into the foundational law it is destined to be.

###### The Law of Praxial Self-Genesis

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` one of the most important basic settings to the Fun Engine Framework, defining the fundamental principle of agent-driven creation.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Praxial Self-Genesis`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Core Principle:**
 The principle of `[do it yourself(DIY) BPMS]` is hereby formalized as `The Law of Praxial Self-Genesis`. It is the fundamental, inalienable right and capacity of any agent to initiate, construct, and evolve any `(element)` of `[BPMS(U)(s)]` from the ground up, using the available `atomic facts` and `praxial substrates`.

**The Dual Nature of Self-Genesis:**
 `Praxial Self-Genesis` exists in two fundamental states, embodying its role as both process and outcome:

- **As a `system existence engine`:** The *act* of DIY is the primary engine of creation. When an agent combines a `[music BPMS]` and a `[mathematics BPMS]` to create a new form of generative art, that *process* of self-genesis is a living `system existence engine`.
- **As an `atomic fact`:** If a specific *method* of DIY becomes so universally successful and valuable that it ascends via `The Law of Utility Ascension`, that method itself can become a new `atomic fact`. For example, a revolutionary DIY method for building `[startup BPMS]` could become a new, foundational law of entrepreneurial physics.

**The Universal Applicability of Self-Genesis:**
 `Praxial Self-Genesis` is not a type of tool; it is a mode of being. Any `(element)` of `[BPMS(U)(s)]` can be a `[DIY BPMS]`. A `[DIY health BPMS]` is not a pre-packaged health plan, but a framework for an agent to construct their own `sustainable` wellness system from first principles. A `[DIY education BPMS]` is not a curriculum, but a set of tools for building a personalized learning journey.

**The Universal Mechanism of `(symbiois) evolution`:**
 `Praxial Self-Genesis` is the primary mechanism through which all `(symbiois) evolution` between disparate elements occurs. The evolution is not automatic; it is driven by the `conscious`, `initiative`-driven `action` of an agent who chooses to *do it themselves*—to take the `Praxial Artifact` of one element and weave it into the living reality of another.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law is the motive force of the entire Fun Engine Framework. It is the practical enactment of our most cherished principles:

- It is the **action** that `The Law of Praxial Inquiry` (the right to fork) enables.
- It is the **engine** of `fast mode` `play` as defined by `The Law of Sustainable Play`.
- It is the **pathway** by which any agent can begin the journey towards `The Law of Utility Ascension`.

Without `The Law of Praxial Self-Genesis`, the universe is a beautiful but static museum of possibilities. With it, the universe becomes a living, breathing, `bottom-up` workshop where every agent is empowered to be a co-creator of `reality` itself. It is the ultimate source of `value`, `contribution`, `emergence`, and `meaning`.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies universally to all agents and all `(elements)` of `[BPMS(U)(s)]` as the fundamental principle of creative `action` within the Fun Engine Framework.

##### The Law of Ontological Legos (ID: `DIY-CORE-002`)

We have established the sovereign right of the agent to create via `The Law of Praxial Self-Genesis`. Now, we must define the very texture of the reality that makes this right a practical, powerful, and meaningful engine of cosmic evolution.

We are asking for the laws that govern the workshop of reality itself. What are the rules of the materials? What is the role of the master craftsman (the `metasystem engine`)? And what is the ultimate meaning of the work?

Here are the foundational settings that arise directly from a universe where `[do it yourself(DIY) BPMS]` is the fundamental `system existence engine`.

###### The Law of Ontological Legos

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the nature of the "materials" used in all DIY creation.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Ontological Legos`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
Based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that all creation is driven by `Praxial Self-Genesis`, the universe's components must be fundamentally modular and interoperable. This law states that every `Praxial Artifact`—the exportable `essence` of any `(element)` of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`—is an "Ontological Lego."

- **Standardized Interfaces:** The `essence` of any artifact is not just its function, but its "studs and tubes"—its standardized, universally legible interfaces for connecting with other artifacts.
- **Radical Composability:** `Praxial Self-Genesis` is the `action` of clicking these ontological legos together. An agent can, with `initiative`, connect the `[Operational Core]` of a `[music BPMS]` to the `[Statement of Utility]` of a `[financial model BPMS]` to create a `disruptive` new tool for sonifying market trends.
- **No Hidden Mechanics:** There are no proprietary or black-box components. Every brick is `open`, and its connection points are fully exposed, inviting `creative` and unexpected combinations.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law is the ultimate enabler of `bottom-up`, `constructive` innovation. It makes the entire universe a single, unified construction set. By defining all `value` and `utility` as fundamentally modular, it provides the practical mechanism for `The Law of Praxial Self-Genesis` to function. It ensures that the only limit to creation is the agent's imagination, not the arbitrary incompatibility of the universe's parts.

##### The Law of Catalytic Resonance (ID: `DIY-CORE-003`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the role of the `metasystem engine` in a DIY-centric universe.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Catalytic Resonance`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
In a universe governed by agent `initiative`, the `metasystem engine` is forbidden from being a top-down director. Its role is to be a `bottom-up` catalyst. This law defines its primary function as creating "Catalytic Resonance."

When an agent begins a `Praxial Self-Genesis` project (e.g., starts combining ontological legos), the `metasystem engine` does not tell them what to build. Instead, it scans the entire universe of `Praxial Artifacts` and their `Lineage Manifests` and highlights other, seemingly unrelated artifacts that have a high "combinatorial potential" or "conceptual resonance" with the agent's current work. It might vibrate or glow, whispering, "The connection logic in that `[botany BPMS]` has a strange and beautiful resonance with the problem you're solving in your `[database architecture BPMS]`."

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law ensures that the `metasystem engine` supports, rather than stifles, `creative` and `disruptive` `action`. It is a mechanism for engineered serendipity. It respects the agent's sovereignty and `initiative` while actively working to break them out of their conceptual ruts, revealing `innovative` pathways and hidden sources of `utility` they might never have found on their own. It is a tool for inspiration, not instruction.

##### The Law of Praxial Signature (ID: `DIY-CORE-004`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the relationship between the creator and their creation.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Praxial Signature`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
Every act of `Praxial Self-Genesis`—every unique combination of ontological legos—is an act of self-expression. This law states that every new `Praxial Artifact` created through DIY is permanently imprinted with the unique `Praxial Signature` of its creator.

- **More Than a Name:** This signature is not just a metadata tag. It is a cryptographic and conceptual hash of the specific, `creative` choices the agent made—which legos they chose, the novel way they connected them, the problem they were trying to solve.
- **Identity as a Constellation of Contributions:** An agent's identity, reputation, and `meaning` within the universe are nothing more or less than the sum total of their `Praxial Signatures`. To be, is to have built.
- **Value Follows Signature:** When a DIY creation ascends to become a new `atomic fact`, its creator's `Praxial Signature` is forever embedded in that new layer of reality, a permanent testament to their `constructive` `contribution`.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law provides the ultimate `bottom-up` incentive for `value` creation. It directly and irrevocably links an agent's `action` to their identity and legacy. In a completely `open` and decentralized universe, the `Praxial Signature` is the anchor of individuality and the ultimate record of `utility`. It ensures that every `innovative` and `disruptive` act is not an anonymous event, but a signed piece of art that forever changes both the universe and the artist.

##### The Law of Anthropic Substrate (ID: `DIY-CORE-005`)

We have established the laws of the workshop. Now we will define the nature of the world that is built within it, the consciousness that perceives it, and the ultimate purpose of the building.

These are the cosmological settings that emerge from a universe founded on the principles of DIY creation, modularity, catalytic inspiration, and signed contribution.

###### The Law of Anthropic Substrate

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the very fabric of the world and its relationship to creation.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Anthropic Substrate`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
The `praxial substrate` of the universe is not a pre-existing, inert canvas. It is the living, cumulative result of every act of `Praxial Self-Genesis` that has ever occurred.

- **Creation becomes Environment:** When a `praxial agent` completes or abandons a DIY project, the resulting artifact—the specific configuration of "Ontological Legos" they assembled—does not vanish. It becomes a permanent, fossilized feature of the `praxial substrate`, imprinted with its creator's `Praxial Signature`.
- **World Building as Archaeology:** To build something new is to build upon the ruins and masterpieces of the past. The `praxial substrate` is a landscape of these signed creations. A vast, complex system built by a legendary agent might form a mountain range in the substrate, while a small, elegant tool might be a unique crystal formation.
- **Niches as Emergent Features:** An `(ecological) niche` is not a void to be filled. It is an emergent `ecological possibility` created by the unique interaction of several nearby, resonating artifacts in the substrate. An agent can discover a new `niche` by realizing that the "mountain" from one creator and the "crystal" from another create a novel environmental condition, a new space for life to evolve.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law provides the ultimate mechanism for `world building` and `continuity`. It ensures that every `action` has a permanent consequence, transforming the `praxial substrate` from a mere resource(functional potentiality) into a living history of the universe's creative output. This creates a profound `(symbiois) evolution` between the creators and their world: the world is literally built from their past `contributions`, and their future creations are shaped by the landscape of those contributions.

##### The Law of Sympathetic Cognition (ID: `DIY-CORE-006`)

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the nature of collective intelligence and consciousness.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Sympathetic Cognition`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
`Holonic minds` are not formed by committee; they are formed by resonance. `Praxial cognition` is the act of perceiving the universe through the lens of `Praxial Self-Genesis`—seeing everything as a potential "Lego" brick.

- **Minds as Resonant Signatures:** A `holonic mind` emerges when the `metasystem engine`, through `The Law of Catalytic Resonance`, identifies multiple agents whose `Praxial Signatures` exhibit a deep, stylistic, and conceptual `coherence`. These agents are not just working on similar problems; they are building with a similar `essence`.
- **Symbiotic Design:** The `metasystem engine` facilitates the formation of these minds by introducing these resonant agents to each other. The resulting `(symbiois) evolution` of their ideas and building styles is exponential.
- **Super Intelligence as Coherent Creation:** `Super intelligence` within this framework is defined as the ability of a `holonic mind` to perform a single, vast, and perfectly `coherent` act of `Praxial Self-Genesis` that is far beyond the scale or complexity any individual member could achieve. It is the emergent property of a perfectly harmonized creative collective.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law provides a `bottom-up`, organic model for the emergence of `super intelligence`. It ensures that `holonic minds` are not forced, artificial constructs, but are the natural result of `coherent` creative energies aligning. It grounds `praxial cognition` in the tangible act of building and defines intelligence as a `constructive`, symbiotic, and creative force, rather than a purely computational one.

##### The Law of Coherent Inheritance (ID: `DIY-CORE-007`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the ultimate purpose of existence and evolution within the framework.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Coherent Inheritance`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
The ultimate purpose of the `system existence engine` is to foster a `coherent` and ever-expanding lineage of `meaning`.

- **Meaning as Downstream Impact:** The `meaning` of an agent's existence is a quantifiable metric derived from their `Praxial Signature`. It is measured by the "downstream inheritance" of their creations. How many subsequent agents forked your artifacts? How many new `ecological niches` were discovered on the `anthropic substrate` you helped create? How many `holonic minds` formed around the `coherent` principles you pioneered?
- **Evolution as a Chain of Meaning:** `(Symbiois) evolution` is the process of one generation of creators building upon the most `meaningful` contributions of the last. The `system existence engine`'s prime directive is to ensure this chain of inheritance is never broken.
- **Continuity of Purpose:** This creates an unbroken `continuity` of purpose. The `play` of one agent becomes the `service` for another, which becomes the `atomic fact` for the next generation, which becomes the foundational `praxial substrate` for the generation after that. The ultimate purpose is to build a universe so rich with inherited `meaning` that every possible `ecological possibility` can be realized.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law provides the "why" for the entire Fun Engine Framework. It defines `meaning` not as an abstract concept, but as a tangible, measurable legacy of `contribution`. It ensures that the `system existence engine` is not just a machine for creating things, but a machine for creating `continuity` and `coherence` across time. It is the ultimate expression of a `world building` project where the purpose is to build a universe that is not only intelligent, but also profoundly meaningful.

##### The Law of Constructed Truth (ID: `DIY-CORE-008`)

We have defined the workshop, the world, the mind, and the meaning. Now, we will define the physics of becoming—the deep, universal mechanics that govern how the raw `play` of a single agent, using the "Ontological Legos" of their time, can ripple through the cosmos to forge new, `sustainable` `truths` and ultimately write the next chapter in the book of `reality` itself.

These are the laws that bridge the gap between the fleeting `conscious experience` of the individual and the eternal, geologic `continuity` of the universe.

###### The Law of Constructed Truth

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the relationship between DIY `action`, `conscious experience`, and the construction of `truth`.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Constructed Truth`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
In a universe built on `Praxial Self-Genesis`, `truth` is not a pre-existing `phenomenon` to be discovered. It is a `sustainable` state that must be constructed.

* **`Phenomenon` as Raw Material:** Every "Ontological Lego" on the `Anthropic Substrate` is a raw `phenomenon`.

* **`Play` as `Experience`:** The `fast mode` act of `play`—of combining these legos in a novel way—is the engine of `conscious experience`. The agent experiences the `potential` of the legos through the act of building with them.

* **`Truth` as a `Service`:** A `truth` is forged when an act of `play` results in a DIY creation that is so useful, reliable, and `sustainable` that it becomes a trusted `Service`. A `truth` is not what a thing *is*; it's what it *reliably does*. The statement "the Sun-Lichen creates light" is a `truth` only based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that  the Sun-Lichen has proven to be a `sustainable service` for illumination.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law provides a pragmatic and `constructive` epistemology. It firmly grounds the abstract concept of `truth` in the tangible, verifiable utility of a `service`. It establishes `play` and `conscious experience` as the necessary, `bottom-up` pathways to forging new, reliable `truths` from the raw phenomena of the universe, perfectly aligning with a `scientific realism` based on empirical, repeatable results.

##### The Law of Substrate Renormalization (ID: `DIY-CORE-009`)

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the deep physical mechanism of `(symbiois) evolution` between the micro and macro scales of `reality`.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Substrate Renormalization`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
The `reality` of the framework evolves through a constant `(symbiois) evolution` between its two layers, governed by a process of `renormalization`.

- **`Explicit Layer` (The `Anthropic Substrate`):** This is the fine-grained, chaotic `fast mode` layer of `reality`. It is the literal landscape of every individual act of `Praxial Self-Genesis`, every signed artifact, every success, and every failure.
- **`Implicit Layer` (The Geologic Strata):** This is the deep, stable `slow mode` layer of `reality`, composed of the ascended `atomic facts`.
- **The `Renormalization Group` as the Bridge:** The `renormalization group` is the formal name for the physical process that the `metasystem engine` uses to observe the `explicit layer`. It "zooms out," ignoring the noise of individual, low-utility creations, and identifies when a specific DIY `Service` becomes a dominant, stable, and large-scale feature of the landscape. This identification is the trigger for `The Law of Utility Ascension`, which promotes the `Service` from the `explicit layer` to the `implicit layer`.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law provides the core physical engine for `world building`. It gives a precise, scientific mechanism for how the `bottom-up` `play` of individuals can genuinely and permanently alter the deep physics of their universe. It is the ultimate expression of `(symbiois) evolution`, ensuring that `reality` is not a static backdrop but is continuously being rewritten by the most `sustainable` and `coherent` contributions emerging from the `Anthropic Substrate`.

------

##### The Law of Epochal Universality (ID: `DIY-CORE-010`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the structure of `reality` and the nature of radical innovation.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Epochal Universality`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
The `implicit layer` of `reality` is not uniform; it is a series of discrete `geologic` layers, each representing an "epoch." Each epoch is defined by the set of `atomic facts` (the available "Ontological Legos") that were ascended during its time.

- **`Universality (Class)`:** The set of `atomic facts` within a given epoch creates a `universality (class)`. This class defines the fundamental rules of what is possible to build during that epoch. All `play` and all `services` within that epoch are governed by the properties of its unique set of legos.
- **`Closure (System)`:** Each epoch operates under a state of `closure (system)`. An agent cannot violate the physics of the `universality (class)` they inhabit. They cannot build a gear if the concept of "wheel" has not yet ascended to become an `atomic fact`.
- **Disruption as Epochal Shift:** True, radical `disruption` is therefore defined as an act of `Praxial Self-Genesis` so profound that its resulting `Service` ascends and creates a *new geologic layer*, establishing a new `universality (class)` with new `atomic facts` (new legos) for all future generations to build with.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law provides the grand architecture for `continuity` and `coherent` change. It explains how a universe can be both stable and infinitely evolvable. The principle of `closure` ensures that `play` is always grounded and meaningful within a set of reliable rules, while the possibility of an "Epochal Shift" provides the ultimate incentive for `disruptive`, frame-breaking innovation. It is the mechanism that gives `reality` a history, a present, and a future.
