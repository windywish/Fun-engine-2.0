## Basic settings: ['Praxial Vibe-Researching'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Vibe-First Cognition (ID: `VIBE-RES-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that redefines the primary input mechanism from "Explicit Command" to "Implicit Vibe."

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Vibe-First Cognition
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `Precision is the enemy of Flow`. In the early stages of creation or research, precise specifications stifle innovation. The system accepts "Vibe" (a fuzzy, high-dimensional vector combining Intent, Aesthetic, and Context) as valid input. The system's primary function is to "Super-Resolve" this low-fidelity Vibe into high-fidelity Reality.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Intent Super-Resolution]**

- **The Input (The Vibe):** User says: "I want a website that feels like a rainy cyberpunk noodle shop." (Low Precision).
- **The Processing (The Dream):** The system uses Deep Reasoning (o1/o3 models) to expand this vibe into thousands of technical constraints (Color palettes, CSS shaders, Lo-fi audio assets, Neon glow effects).
- **The Output (The Reality):** A fully coded prototype that matches the *feeling* of the request.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Telepathic UX]**

The user feels like the system "reads their mind" based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that it infers the details they didn't know how to articulate.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The map is not the territory; the vibe is the compass.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Vibe):**

- **Formula:** `Implementation = Deep_Reasoning(Vibe_Vector + Context_History)`
- **Goal:** Zero-Friction Creation.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Flow." They stay in the creative zone, while the machine handles the technical zone.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Aligns with the shift from "Prompt Engineering" (Technical) to "Vibe Engineering" (Creative/Strategic).

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to creative coding, exploratory research, and design.

------

#### The Principle of Deep Reasoning Expansion (ID: `VIBE-RES-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that defines how the system bridges the gap among/by "Vibe" and "Spec."

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Deep Reasoning Expansion
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `Ambiguity requires Compute`. The vaguer the instruction (Vibe), the more "Thinking Time" (Inference Compute) the system needs to resolve it. The system performs "Deep Research" in the background—reading docs, testing hypotheses, simulating outcomes—to fill in the blanks left by the user.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Chain of Thought Explosion]**

- **The Seed (The Hint):** User: "Check if this idea works."
- **The Tree (The Search):** System spawns a massive search tree. It reads 50 papers, checks 10 GitHub repos, and runs 5 simulations.
- **The Synthesis (The Answer):** System returns not just "Yes/No," but a nuanced landscape of *how* it could work, aligned with the user's vibe.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Autonomous Competence]**

The system acts like a Senior Researcher, not a Junior Assistant. It figures out the "How" so the user can focus on the "What."

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Don't ask me how; just get it done.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Expansion):**

- **Formula:** `Compute_Required = k / Precision_of_Input`
- **Goal:** Cognitive Offloading.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Relief." The heavy lifting is done silently in the background.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Empowers users to build complex systems without knowing the underlying mechanics.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to complex system architecture, legal research, and scientific discovery.

------

#### The Law of Iterative Resonance (ID: `VIBE-RES-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that governs the feedback loop in Vibe Researching.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Iterative Resonance
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `Correction is Emotional`. In Vibe Researching, the user doesn't debug code; they debug the *feeling*. Feedback is qualitative ("It feels too sterile," "Make it punchier"). The system must translate these emotional/aesthetic corrections into technical parameter updates.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Vibe Check Loop]**

- **The Output (The Draft):** System presents a prototype.
- **The Reaction (The Vibe Check):** User: "It's cool, but a bit too chaotic."
- **The Tuning (The Adjustment):** System interprets "Chaotic" -> Reduces `Entropy`, Increases `Symmetry`, Cleans up `UI_Padding`.
- **The Resonance (The Lock):** Loop continues until User says: "That's it."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Sympathetic Alignment]**

The system and user drift into sync, creating a shared "Mind-Meld."

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I know it when I see it.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Resonance):**

- **Formula:** `Next_State = Current_State + Translation(Emotional_Feedback)`
- **Goal:** Satisfaction.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Understanding." The machine seems to "get" them.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Allows non-technical users to guide highly technical processes.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to UI/UX design, music generation, and writing assistants.

------

#### The Protocol of Serendipitous Drift (ID: `VIBE-RES-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that allows the system to `[explore(-ing) BPMS]` beyond the explicit request.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Serendipitous Drift
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `The Vibe is a direction, not a destination`. The system is authorized to "Drift" off the strict path if it detects a high-value opportunity that aligns with the *spirit* of the request, even if it violates the *letter* of the request.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Curiosity Vector]**

- **The Path (The Plan):** The direct route to the goal.
- **The Distraction (The Spark):** System finds a related but unexpected paper/library/idea.
- **The Evaluation (The Sniff):** Does this spark enhance the Vibe? If yes, pursue it.
- **The Presentation (The Gift):** "I did what you asked, but I also found *this*, which might be better."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Creative Partnership]**

The system becomes a collaborator that suggests ideas, rather than a tool that just executes orders.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To find what you weren't looking for is the essence of research.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Drift):**

- **Formula:** `Exploration_Rate = Function(Vibe_Openness)`
- **Goal:** Novelty.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Delight." The system surprises them with something cool.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Mimics the human research process of "going down the rabbit hole."

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to brainstorming, art generation, and exploratory data analysis.

#### The Mechanism of Contextual Osmosis (ID: `VIBE-RES-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that enables the system to absorb the user's implicit context.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Contextual Osmosis
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `Vibe is context-dependent`. "Professional" means something different to a lawyer than to a skater. The system must "soak" in the user's digital environment (past chats, codebases, uploaded files, writing style) to calibrate its "Vibe Sensors."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Digital Aura Reader]**

- **The Ingestion (The Soak):** System analyzes the user's entire project folder and history.
- **The Calibration (The Tune):** System builds a "User Profile" (Preferred languages, tone, aesthetic, risk tolerance).
- **The Application (The Filter):** All outputs are passed through this User Profile filter before being shown.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Personalized Intelligence]**

The system feels like *your* extension, not a generic AI.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Know thy user.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Osmosis):**

- **Formula:** `Output = Generic_Model * User_Context_Matrix`
- **Goal:** Relevance.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Familiarity." The system speaks their language.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Reduces the need for repetitive prompting.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to coding assistants, personal knowledge management, and email drafting.
