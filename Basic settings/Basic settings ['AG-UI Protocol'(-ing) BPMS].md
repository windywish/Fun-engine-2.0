## Basic settings: ['AG-UI Protocol'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Event-Driven Agency (ID: `AG-UI-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that implements **`['AG-UI Protocol'(-ing) BPMS]`** as the **`['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`** for agent-user communication. It establishes that the "existence" of the relationship among/by User and Agent is defined by a persistent, bi-directional **Event Stream**.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```

```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `agency is a conversation of events`. The Agent is not a static backend that replies to requests; it is a persistent entity connected via a "Nervous System" (AG-UI). This protocol defines the standard for transmitting **Intents** (User wants X), **States** (Agent is thinking), and **Effects** (UI updates) in real-time.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Nervous System]**

- **The Bi-Directional Stream (The Synapse):** The system establishes a persistent WebSocket/TCP connection among/by the `['Godot Engine'(-ing) BPMS]` (Client) and the `['Voyager'(-ing) BPMS]` (Agent).

- The Event Taxonomy (The Signals):

  It standardizes the vocabulary of interaction:

  - `input.text`: User speaks.
  - `agent.state`: Agent updates its status (Thinking, Acting).
  - `tool.call`: Agent requests a physics action.
  - `ui.render`: Agent sends an A2UI payload.

- **The Interruptibility (The Reflex):** The protocol enforces that *any* agent action can be interrupted by a user event, mimicking the biological ability to stop a thought mid-stream.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Responsive Life]**

The creation of an agent that feels "alive." It doesn't just "reply"; it streams its consciousness. It can change its mind if the user interrupts. It exists in the same temporal flow as the user.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Time is shared.* The Agent and User inhabit the same timeline. The protocol must support asynchronous, overlapping events.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Events):**

The "Physics" of interaction is **Stream Processing**:

- **If `[Protocol(-ing) BPMS]`: (Signal Physics)**

Interaction=Stream(UserEvents)⋈Stream(AgentEvents)

The interaction is the "Join" of two infinite streams.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent/user experiences "Immediacy." The latency of "Request/Response" is replaced by the fluidity of "Push/Pull."

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]` by keeping the connection "alive" (Heartbeat). It is the "really working implementation" of the abstract concept of Agent-User interaction.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to chat interfaces, voice conversations, real-time strategy controls, and co-pilot coding assistants within the framework.
