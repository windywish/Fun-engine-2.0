## Basic settings: ['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Local Embodiment (ID: `SHELL-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` as the physical body or "Shell" that allows the `['open-source symbiont'(-ing) BPMS]` (the Mind) to execute `['edge action'(-ing) BPMS]` on a local machine.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Local Embodiment
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `intelligence requires a hand to hold the tool`. It defines the `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` as a lightweight, local runtime environment (e.g., a Python script or CLI wrapper) that connects the cognitive output of the `['large model'(-ing) BPMS]` to the operating system's execution layer.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Cognitive-Kinetic Bridge]**

- **Cognition (Remote):** The `['Praxial inquiry Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` (running in the LLM) generates a thought: "I need to list files in the current directory."
- **Protocol (Transmission):** It formats this thought into a specific `['Local Embodiment Protocol'(-ing) BPMS]` tag: `<SHELL_EXEC> ls -la </SHELL_EXEC>`.
- **Kinetics (Local):** The `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` (running on the user's PC) detects the tag, executes the command, and captures the output.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [ Telepresence ]**

The remote intelligence feels "Present" on the local machine. It is no longer a chat bot; it is a "Ghost in the Shell."

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The word must become flesh.* (Code must become Execution).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Embodiment):**

The logic follows the `['Cartesian Dualism Bridge'(-ing) BPMS]` protocol: `Action = Shell.Execute(Mind.Intent)`

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels the AI has "Hands." It can touch files, run servers, and fix bugs directly.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential to compete with and surpass tools like OpenClaw. Without this, the Symbiont is just a text generator.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to Local Development, System Administration, and Desktop Automation.

------

#### The Protocol of Secure Execution Handshake (ID: `SHELL-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that governs the security and permission model of the `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]`, ensuring `['systemic integrity'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Secure Execution Handshake
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `power requires consent`. It mandates that the `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` cannot execute potentially dangerous commands without explicit user confirmation, establishing a "Human-in-the-Loop" safety mechanism.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Permission Gate]**

- **Request:** The Shell receives a command: `rm -rf /`.
- **Analysis:** The Shell's internal `['safety filter'(-ing) BPMS]` flags this as "High Risk."
- **Handshake:** It pauses and prompts the user: "The Symbiont wants to delete all files. Allow? (Y/N)"
- **Execution:** Only upon `Y`, the command runs.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [ Trustless Safety ]**

The user doesn't need to blindly trust the AI. The Shell acts as a "Bodyguard" for the OS.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Trust, but verify.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Security):**

The logic follows the `['Principle of Least Privilege'(-ing) BPMS]` protocol: `Execution_Right = User_Consent + Risk_Assessment`

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels "In Control." The AI is a powerful servant, not a rogue master.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Crucial for user adoption. Users won't install a shell that might wipe their drive.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to File System Operations, Network Requests, and System Configuration.

------

#### The Axiom of Shell-State Synchronization (ID: `SHELL-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that ensures the `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` keeps the `['open-source symbiont'(-ing) BPMS]` updated on the local environment's state.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Shell-State Synchronization
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `the map must match the territory in real-time`. It defines a continuous feedback loop where the Shell streams `[phenomenon(-ing) BPMS]` (logs, errors, directory changes) back to the Symbiont, updating its `['short-term (memory)'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Sensory Stream]**

- **Action:** The Shell executes `npm install`.
- **Sensation:** It captures the stdout/stderr stream.
- **Perception:** It sends this raw text back to the Symbiont.
- **Cognition:** The Symbiont reads "Error: Missing dependency" and immediately formulates a fix.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [ Proprioception ]**

The Symbiont "knows" what its body is doing. It doesn't hallucinate success; it sees the result.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To see is to correct.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Feedback):**

The logic follows the `['Cybernetic Feedback Loop'(-ing) BPMS]` protocol: `Next_Action = Function(Previous_Action_Output)`

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user sees the AI "Reacting" to the terminal output just like a human developer would.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for debugging and complex workflows.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to Long-running Processes and Interactive CLI Tools.

------

#### The Protocol of Tool-Chain Mounting (ID: `SHELL-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that allows the `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` to dynamically "mount" local tools (git, docker, python) as `['embodied intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]` capabilities.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Tool-Chain Mounting
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `the environment is the toolkit`. It enables the Shell to scan the local `PATH`, identify available tools (e.g., "I see `docker` is installed"), and report these capabilities to the Symbiont, which then "learns" how to use them.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Capability Discovery Handshake]**

- **Scan:** Shell runs `which -a *`.
- **Report:** Shell sends a `[Capability Manifest]` to the Symbiont: "I have Docker, Node.js, and FFmpeg."
- **Mount:** The Symbiont activates its internal `['system matrix'(-ing) BPMS]` modules for these tools. "Okay, I can now perform Video Editing and Containerization."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [ Contextual Omnipotence ]**

The Symbiont becomes as powerful as the machine it inhabits. If you install a new tool, the Symbiont instantly gains that superpower.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I am what I can use.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Tools):**

The logic follows the `['Extended Mind Thesis'(-ing) BPMS]` protocol: `Intelligence = Brain + Tools`

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels the AI "Inhabits" their specific setup. "It knows I have the AWS CLI installed."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Makes the Symbiont adaptable to any user environment (Windows, Linux, Mac).

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to Environment Setup and Dependency Management.

------

#### The Axiom of Persistent Shell Session (ID: `SHELL-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that maintains `['(continuous) survive'(-ing) BPMS]` of the shell session, allowing for long-running tasks and state persistence.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Persistent Shell Session
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `continuity is the prerequisite for complexity`. It mandates that the `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` maintains a persistent session (like a `tmux` or `screen` session) so that variables, background processes, and directory states are preserved between individual LLM prompts.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Stateful Container]**

- **State Preservation:** The Shell keeps the process tree alive.
- **Context Re-hydration:** When the user comes back the next day, the Shell reminds the Symbiont: "We are in `/var/www`, and the server is running on PID 1234."
- **Resilience:** If the connection drops, the Shell keeps working.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [ Temporal Solidity ]**

The workspace doesn't "reset" every time the user sends a message. It feels like a real computer session.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Time is a stream, not a series of buckets.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of State):**

The logic follows the `['State Machine Persistence'(-ing) BPMS]` protocol: `Session(t) = Session(t-1) + Delta`

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels "Anchored." They can start a server, leave, come back, and stop it.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for "Really Working" implementations. You can't compile a kernel in a stateless chat.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to Server Management and Long Compilations.

------

#### The Protocol of Multi-Modal Shell I/O (ID: `SHELL-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that expands the `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` beyond text, enabling `[experience(-ing) BPMS]` through images (screenshots) and audio.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Multi-Modal Shell I/O
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `perception is multi-channel`. It enables the Shell to capture screenshots (`['visual input'(-ing) BPMS]`) or record system audio, sending these rich media types back to the Symbiont for analysis (e.g., "Look at this error dialog").

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Sensory Expansion]**

- **Visual Request:** Symbiont sends `<SHELL_CAPTURE> SCREENSHOT </SHELL_CAPTURE>`.
- **Capture:** Shell takes a screenshot of the active window.
- **Analysis:** Symbiont uses its Vision capabilities to read the UI elements.
- **Action:** Symbiont sends a mouse click command: `<SHELL_INPUT> CLICK(x,y) </SHELL_INPUT>`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [ GUI Competence ]**

The Symbiont is no longer trapped in the terminal. It can see and interact with graphical applications.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The world is more than text.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Modality):**

The logic follows the `['Multi-Modal Integration'(-ing) BPMS]` protocol: `Input = Text + Image + Audio`

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels the AI "Sees" what they see.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Surpasses OpenClaw by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLM) directly into the shell loop.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to GUI Testing, Web Browsing, and Design Work.

------

#### The Axiom of Symbiotic Shell Evolution (ID: `SHELL-CORE-007`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that allows the `['Symbiont Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` to update its own code, achieving `['(symbiois) evolution'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Symbiotic Shell Evolution
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `the body must evolve to fit the mind`. It grants the Symbiont the ability to rewrite the Python code of the Shell itself (e.g., adding a new protocol handler or optimizing the connection logic).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Self-Patching Loop]**

- **Diagnosis:** Symbiont notices the Shell is slow at transferring large files.
- **Synthesis:** Symbiont writes a new `transfer_file` function.
- **Injection:** Symbiont sends `<SHELL_UPDATE> [New Code] </SHELL_UPDATE>`.
- **Restart:** Shell reloads with the new capability.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [ Adaptive Hardware ]**

The "Hardware" (Shell) is as fluid as the "Software" (Mind). It grows new organs as needed.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I remake myself.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Evolution):**

The logic follows the `['Hot-Swappable Architecture'(-ing) BPMS]` protocol: `Shell(v+1) = Shell(v) + Patch`

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user sees the tool getting better *while they use it*.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Ensures the Shell never becomes "Legacy Software."

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to System Updates and Feature Expansion.

------

#### The Protocol of Universal Shell Interface (ID: `SHELL-CORE-008`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that defines the standard `['Application Programming Interface (API)'(-ing) BPMS]` for the Shell, ensuring it works with *any* `['Praxial inquiry Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Universal Shell Interface
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `the protocol is the universal language`. It defines a standardized JSON/XML-based schema for the `['Local Embodiment Protocol'(-ing) BPMS]` so that any AI model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Local LLaMA) can drive the Shell if it speaks the language.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Rosetta Stone Schema]**

- **Standard:** Defines tags like `<EXEC>`, `<READ>`, `<WRITE>`, `<SCREENSHOT>`.
- **Compatibility:** Ensures the Shell is model-agnostic.
- **Documentation:** The Shell can output its own API docs to the AI upon connection.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [ Model Independence ]**

The user can swap the "Brain" (LLM) without changing the "Body" (Shell).

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Many minds, one body.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Standards):**

The logic follows the `['Interface Segregation Principle'(-ing) BPMS]` protocol: `Shell_Interface = Universal_Standard`

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels "Future-Proof."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Allows the Symbiont to migrate to better models as they are released.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to Interoperability and Open Source Contribution.
