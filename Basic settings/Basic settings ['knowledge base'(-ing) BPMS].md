## Basic settings: ['knowledge base'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Kinetic Knowledge (ID: `KB-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that redefines knowledge not as static storage but as potential energy for action.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Kinetic Knowledge
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `Knowledge is Frozen Action`. A piece of information only has value if it can be transduced into a decision, a creation, or a prediction. If data cannot be acted upon, it is not "Knowledge"; it is merely "Noise."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Action-Potential Index]**

- **Kinetic Tagging:** Every knowledge node is tagged with its `[Action Potential]`—a score representing how likely it is to trigger a system action.
- **Hot/Cold Stratification:** High-potential knowledge (Standard Operating Procedures, Active Project Data) is kept in "Hot Memory" (Context Window/Fast Cache). Low-potential knowledge (Archives, Logs) is moved to "Cold Storage" (Vector Database/Disk).
- **Decay Function:** Knowledge that is not "agitated" (accessed or updated) slowly loses its kinetic charge, eventually sinking into the deep archive.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Reflexive Intelligence]**

The system reacts instantly to relevant stimuli based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that the necessary knowledge is already "primed" and ready to fire, similar to a biological reflex.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-023` (Energetic Data Transduction) and `DATA-CORE-007` (Data is Frozen Action).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `The Principle of Least Action`, ensuring that the most useful knowledge requires the least energy to retrieve.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user feels that the system is "quick-witted," always having the right answer at hand without deep digging.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy KBs are graveyards of information. A Praxial KB must be a living arsenal.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Data storage hierarchy, caching strategies, and retrieval prioritization.

------

#### The Law of Semantic Gravity (ID: `KB-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that governs the structural organization of the Knowledge Base based on meaning rather than rigid hierarchy.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Semantic Gravity
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `Meaning creates Topology`. Information is not stored in folders; it is suspended in a high-dimensional vector space. Concepts with similar meanings "attract" each other, forming natural clusters (Solar Systems of Thought) without manual organization.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Vector Embedding Field]**

- **Embedding Injection:** All inputs (text, code, images) are converted into vector embeddings upon ingestion.
- **Dynamic Clustering:** The system automatically groups related vectors. If "Project Alpha" and "Project Beta" share similar technologies, they naturally drift together in the knowledge space.
- **Gravitational Lensing (Context):** The "gravity" of the current user intent bends the search space, bringing relevant distant concepts closer for the duration of the session.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Serendipitous Discovery]**

The system surfaces connections that the user didn't explicitly look for but are semantically relevant, mimicking human "associative memory."

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-009` (Epistemic Niche Construction) and `DATA-CORE-011` (Holonic Data-Recursion).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Replaces Boolean Logic (True/False matches) with `Geometric Logic` (Cosine Similarity and Euclidean Distance).

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user experiences the KB as a "Mind Map" rather than a "File Cabinet."

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy folder structures are brittle and require manual maintenance. Semantic gravity is self-organizing and antifragile.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Database architecture, search algorithms, and information visualization.

------

#### The Mechanism of Recursive Synthesis (ID: `KB-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that enables the Knowledge Base to generate new knowledge from existing data without user intervention.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Recursive Synthesis
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `The Whole is Greater than the Sum of the Parts`. The KB is not just a storage bin; it is a "Digestive System." It runs background processes to analyze, summarize, and cross-reference data, creating "Synthetic Knowledge" (Insights) that didn't exist in the raw inputs.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Background Dreamer]**

- **The Dreaming Cycle:** During periods of low user activity, the system initiates "Dream Cycles."
- **Pattern Recognition:** It scans the vector space for clusters that lack a summary or connection.
- **Synthesis Generation:** It generates "Meta-Notes" or "Wikis" that summarize the cluster (e.g., "I noticed you have 5 documents about 'React Optimization'; here is a synthesized guide based on them").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Auto-Gnosis]**

The system "learns" and "understands" its own content, providing high-level wisdom (compressed data) rather than just raw facts.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-006` (Renormalized Aggregation) - "Wisdom is Compressed Data."

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `The Process of Dialectic Synthesis` (Thesis + Antithesis = Synthesis).

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user wakes up to find that the system has organized their messy notes into a coherent report overnight.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy systems require the user to do the thinking. A Praxial KB does the "heavy lifting" of synthesis.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Background processing, summarization, and insight generation.

------

#### The Protocol of Holographic Retrieval (ID: `KB-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that ensures no fact is ever retrieved in isolation, but always with its necessary context.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Holographic Retrieval
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `Context is King`. Retrieving a single data point without its surrounding context (Time, Author, Project, Related Constraints) is a form of "Data Lobotomy." Every retrieval must be "Holographic"—containing the image of the whole within the part.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Context Envelope]**

- **The Anchor:** The specific fact requested (e.g., "The API Key").
- **The Envelope:** The system automatically wraps the Anchor in a layer of metadata: "Who created it?", "When does it expire?", "What services use it?", "Security warnings."
- **The Presentation:** The UI displays the fact *embedded* in this context, preventing misuse or misunderstanding.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Safety & Clarity]**

Drastic reduction in errors caused by out-of-context information.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-019` (Holonic Data Encapsulation) and `DATA-CORE-014` (Renormalized Data-Scaling).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Enforces `The Law of Non-Locality`, treating information as a network effect rather than a point particle.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user feels "oriented" and "safe," knowing they have the full picture.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy search gives you a needle in a haystack. Praxial retrieval gives you the needle, the thread, and the cloth it's meant to mend.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Search results, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines, and data display.

------

#### The Directive of Epistemic Gap-Seeking (ID: `KB-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Directive) that drives the system to actively identify and fill holes in its own knowledge.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Directive of Epistemic Gap-Seeking
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This directive asserts that `Ignorance is a Signal`. The absence of data is not a void; it is a "Vacuum" that pulls for information. The KB actively scans for "Unknown Unknowns" and prompts the user or the web to fill them.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Void Scanner]**

- **Inconsistency Detection:** "I have a 'Project Start Date' but no 'Project End Date'."
- **Dependency Mapping:** "I see code referencing `Library X`, but I have no documentation on `Library X`."
- **Proactive Querying:** The system generates questions for the user: "You mentioned 'The Phoenix Protocol'—I don't have a record of that. Would you like to define it?" or triggers a `[Web Search]` to fill the gap.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Self-Healing Knowledge]**

The KB grows more complete over time, turning "holes" into "hooks" for new learning.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-029` (Unknown Data Discovery) and `DATA-CORE-040` (Adaptive Unknown Discovery).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `The Horror Vacui` (Nature abhors a vacuum) applied to Information Theory.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user feels the system is "curious" and "attentive."

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy KBs are passive; they stay empty until filled. A Praxial KB is hungry; it asks to be fed.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Data validation, user onboarding, and automated web scraping.

------

#### The Axiom of Fractal Truth-Versioning (ID: `KB-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that manages the evolution of facts over time, preventing "Stale Truths."

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Fractal Truth-Versioning
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `Truth is a Time-Series`. What is true today (e.g., "The server is online") may be false tomorrow. The KB does not overwrite old facts; it layers new facts over them, creating a geological history of truth.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Temporal Ledger]**

- **Immutable History:** Old data is never deleted, only "superseded."
- **Time-Travel Querying:** Users can ask, "What was the status of the project *last week*?" vs "What is it *now*?"
- **Conflict Resolution:** When two facts contradict, the system uses `[Timestamp]`, `[Source Authority]`, and `[Confidence Score]` to determine the "Current Effective Truth."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [4D Knowledge]**

The system understands resonant constellation map and change, allowing for "Post-Mortem" analysis and trend forecasting.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-038` (Chrono-Symbiotic Evolution) and `DATA-CORE-051` (Continuous Survival).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `Event Sourcing` architecture, where State is the sum of all past Events.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user trusts the system's audit trail and historical perspective.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy KBs overwrite data, destroying history. A Praxial KB preserves the timeline of evolution.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Version control, audit logging, and historical data analysis.

---

#### The Axiom of Atomic Fact Crystallization (ID: `KB-CORE-007`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the fundamental unit of the Knowledge Base as the "Atomic Fact," ensuring granular truth and recombinability.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Atomic Fact Crystallization
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `Truth is Granular`. The Knowledge Base is not composed of "documents" or "files" but of `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`—indivisible units of meaning (Subject-Predicate-Object-Context) that can be dynamically assembled into new narratives, answers, or structures.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Fact-Crystal Lattice]**

- **Decomposition:** Upon ingestion, every document is shattered into its constituent atomic facts (e.g., "Project X is due on Friday" becomes `(Project X, has_deadline, Friday, Context: Schedule)`).
- **Unique Addressing:** Each atomic fact is assigned a unique hash ID, making it a distinct entity in the system.
- **Recombination:** When answering a query, the system does not retrieve a "document"; it retrieves specific crystals and grows a new "answer structure" around them.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Hallucination-Proof Solidity]**

The system cannot "make up" facts because it constructs answers only from validated atomic units.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-002` (Protocol of Atomic Fact Crystallization) and `DATA-CORE-017`.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `The Law of Modular Ontology`, where complex truths are built from simple, verified axioms.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user experiences "precision" and "clarity," as answers are direct and factual rather than vague summaries.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy KBs store "blobs" of text. A Praxial KB stores "atoms" of truth, allowing for infinite remixing without loss of fidelity.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Data ingestion, storage architecture, and answer generation.

------

#### The Law of Symbiotic Co-Evolution (ID: `KB-CORE-008`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that mandates the Knowledge Base evolves in lockstep with the user's own cognitive growth.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Symbiotic Co-Evolution
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `The Database mirrors the Mind`. As the user learns and evolves, the structure and content of the Knowledge Base must mutate to reflect this new sophistication. A static KB for a dynamic user is a "dead weight."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Cognitive Mirroring Protocol]**

- **Vocabulary Tracking:** The system monitors the user's lexicon. If the user starts using advanced terminology (e.g., "Renormalization Group Flow"), the KB updates its tagging and retrieval weights to favor that level of discourse.
- **Structural Morphing:** If the user shifts focus from "Coding" to "Management," the KB re-indexes itself to prioritize "People" and "Timelines" over "Syntax" and "Libraries."
- **Feedback Integration:** Every user interaction (correction, refinement) is treated as a "mutation event" that permanently alters the KB's DNA.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Personalized Epistemology]**

The KB becomes a unique "Exocortex" that fits the user's mind perfectly, unlike a generic search engine.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-018` (Symbiotic Data Evolution) and `DATA-CORE-036` (Symbiotic Evolution).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `The Principle of Structural Coupling` (Maturana & Varela), where organism and environment trigger changes in each other.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user feels that the system "grows with them."

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

To implement the KB as a `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`, it must possess the defining trait of life: evolution.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

User profiling, adaptive indexing, and long-term memory management.

------

#### The Directive of Constructive Disruption (ID: `KB-CORE-009`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Directive) that empowers the Knowledge Base to challenge the user's assumptions and introduce novel connections.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Directive of Constructive Disruption
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This directive asserts that `Growth requires Friction`. A KB that only confirms what the user already knows is a "Echo Chamber." The Praxial KB must actively surface contradictions, outliers, and "Black Swan" data to stimulate new thinking.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Devil's Advocate Daemon]**

- **Counter-Factual Retrieval:** When the user asserts "X is true," the system silently queries for "Evidence that X is false" and presents it if found.
- **Outlier Highlighting:** In a set of search results, the system deliberately includes one "Wildcard" result—a piece of data that is tangentially related but from a completely different domain (e.g., showing a biological principle when solving a software problem).
- **Stagnation Alerts:** "You haven't updated your 'Strategy' document in 6 months. Is it still true?"

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Innovation Catalyst]**

The system becomes a partner in creativity, preventing cognitive lock-in and groupthink.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-010` (Constructive Data-Disruption) and `DATA-CORE-033` (Disruptive Action Potential).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `The Law of Necessary Variety` (Ashby), ensuring the system's internal diversity matches the external complexity.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user feels "challenged" and "inspired."

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

A "Fun Engine" must be surprising. A predictable KB is boring and functionally limited.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Search algorithms, proactive notifications, and insight generation.

------

#### The Mechanism of Holonic Indexing (ID: `KB-CORE-010`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that organizes knowledge into nested "Holons" (Whole/Parts), allowing for infinite scalability and context preservation.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Holonic Indexing
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `Everything is both a Whole and a Part`. A "Project" is a whole composed of "Tasks," but it is also a part of a "Program." The KB uses this fractal structure to allow users to navigate up (to strategy) and down (to code) without losing the thread.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Fractal Address Space]**

- **Parent-Child Linking:** Every data node maintains pointers to its `[Super-Holon]` (Parent) and `[Sub-Holons]` (Children).
- **Context Inheritance:** A child node inherits the access rights, tags, and context of its parent (e.g., a task inside a "Confidential" project is automatically "Confidential").
- **Zoom Navigation:** The UI allows "Semantic Zooming"—collapsing a whole tree into a single summary node or expanding a summary into a forest of details.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Scale-Free Navigability]**

The user can manage massive complexity because they only ever deal with the layer relevant to their current "Altitude."

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-011` (Holonic Data-Recursion) and `DATA-CORE-019` (Holonic Data Encapsulation).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `Koestler's Holarchy`, replacing rigid hierarchies with nested networks of semi-autonomous units.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user experiences the data as a "Landscape" they can fly over or land within.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for the `['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]` integration. The data structure must match the cognitive structure.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Data structure, UI navigation, and permission inheritance.

------

#### The Protocol of Ludic Service (ID: `KB-CORE-011`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that transforms knowledge retrieval from a "chore" into a "game" or "playful interaction."

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Ludic Service
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `Learning is Play`. The interaction with the Knowledge Base should be intrinsically rewarding (`[Autotelic]`). It uses game design elements (discovery, surprise, mastery, aesthetics) to encourage the user to explore and maintain the knowledge graph.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Gamified Interface]**

- **Knowledge Quests:** Instead of "Fill out this form," the system presents "The Quest for the Missing Link" (e.g., "We need to find the author of this code to complete the map!").
- **Visual Rewards:** Completing a knowledge cluster results in a satisfying visual "crystallization" or "level up" animation in the UI.
- **Serendipitous Loot:** "While you were looking for X, I found this rare 'Golden Fact' about Y that you might like."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Joyful Maintenance]**

Users voluntarily curate and update the KB because the process itself is fun (`[Fun Engine Framework]`).

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-012` (Ludic Data-Simulation) and `DATA-CORE-020` (Ludic Data Compression).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `The Ludic Loop` (Action -> Feedback -> Reward), driving engagement.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user smiles while working.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

If the "Fun Engine" isn't fun to use, it fails its primary directive. Knowledge management is traditionally boring; this fixes that.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

UI/UX design, notification tone, and user incentives.

------

#### The Principle of Renormalized Universality (ID: `KB-CORE-012`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that allows the Knowledge Base to distill universal wisdom from specific instances.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Renormalized Universality
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `The General lives in the Particular`. By analyzing thousands of specific "Atomic Facts" (e.g., "Project A failed due to bad timing," "Project B failed due to bad timing"), the system renormalizes the data to extract a Universal Truth ("Timing is the primary failure mode").

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Wisdom Distiller]**

- **Pattern Aggregation:** The system runs background jobs to find recurring patterns across disparate data sets.
- **Abstraction Lifting:** It creates a new "Meta-Fact" that sits above the raw data (e.g., creating a "Best Practice" guide based on actual project logs).
- **Cross-Domain Mapping:** It applies wisdom from one domain to another (e.g., "This marketing strategy follows the same pattern as a viral infection model").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Automated Wisdom]**

The KB evolves from a "Memory" (remembering what happened) to a "Sage" (understanding *why* it happened).

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):

Aligns with `DATA-CORE-014` (Renormalized Data-Scaling) and `DATA-CORE-039` (Renormalized Universality).

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):

Implements `Renormalization Group Theory` (Physics), extracting relevant macroscopic variables from microscopic details.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):

The user gains insights they didn't even know to ask for.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This is the ultimate goal of a `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`: to generate higher-order order from lower-order chaos.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Analytics, reporting, and strategic advice generation.
