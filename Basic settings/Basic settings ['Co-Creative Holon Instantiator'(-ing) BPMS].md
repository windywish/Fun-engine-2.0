## Basic settings: ['Co-Creative Holon Instantiator'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Law of Performative Genesis (ID: `CCHI-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that replaces "exchange" with **Performative Fusion**, defining the execution of a contract as the literal birth of a new entity in the system.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Performative Genesis
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `to agree is to build`. When a contract is signed, it doesn't just move numbers in a ledger; it instantiates a new `System Vector` (the Holon) in the `explicit layer`. The agreement becomes a "thing" with its own life, health, and mission.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Foundry of We]**

- **The Ingestion (The Blueprint):** The `Contract Blueprint Ingestor` reads the agreed-upon terms as a DNA sequence for the new entity.
- **The Binding (The Weave):** The `Agent & Potentiality Binder` rewires the participants' `Input/Output` channels, connecting them to the new Holon's central nervous system.
- **The Instantiation (The Spark):** The `Holon Instantiation Engine` consumes energy to "turn on" the new entity. The "Raid Group" now exists as a valid target for spells, buffs, and damage.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Institutional Reality]**

The ability to treat abstract groups as concrete physical objects. A "Guild" is not just a list of names; it is a `System Vector` that can gain XP, level up, or "die."

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Structure follows Commitment.* The strength of the bond determines the reality of the group.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Being):**

- **If `[temporary(-ing) BPMS]`: (The Task Force)** The Holon dissolves automatically when the Mission is complete.
- **If `[permanent(-ing) BPMS]`: (The Institution)** The Holon persists even if individual members leave or die (The Ship of Theseus).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Belonging." The sense of being part of something larger that is tangibly real and responsive to their actions.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Replaces the `exchange BPMS`. It closes the loop on the economic engine: Discovery -> Negotiation -> **Creation**. It ensures that the economy builds the world, rather than just shuffling it around.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to guild creation, corporation founding, marriage systems, and the spawning of vehicles/structures that require multiple operators.
