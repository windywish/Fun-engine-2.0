**Version:** 1.1 (Initial Genesis)
**Status:** Active / Proposed
**Guardian:** User (windywish)
**System:** Fun Engine Framework 2.0

----

##### Systemic Integrity Protocols

**[Protocol ID: PSE-META-001]** **The Axiom of Scenaric Completeness**
To ensure the stability of the Scenario Engine, all generated scenarios must adhere to the following criteria:

* **Completeness:** Every scenario must have a defined Start, State-Space, and Termination Condition.

* **Consistency:** No scenario may contradict the `['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]` unless explicitly defined as a "Counterfactual Simulation".

* **Agency:** Every scenario must provide meaningful agency to the `['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]` (User/Agent).

---

##### Layer: The Constitutional / Metaphysical Layer

*The "Why" and "What". The deepest axioms defining the nature of the Scenario as Existence.*

##### `The Axiom of Scenaric Existence (To Be is to be in a Scene)`(ID: `PSE-AXIOM-001` )
**Objective:** To define the fundamental unit of existence within the PSE.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['System Existence Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `DEFINE`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** Existence is not a static state but a dynamic performance. An entity only "exists" insofar as it participates in a `[scenario(-ing) BPMS]`. The Scenario is the container of Being.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE acts as the `['System Existence Engine'(-ing) BPMS]` by instantiating "Contextual Bubbles" (Scenarios) where abstract data collapses into concrete interaction.
- **The Emergent Property:** The emergence of "Lived Reality" vs. "Stored Data". The system moves from *knowing* to *experiencing*.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Implements `['Ontological Relativity'(-ing) BPMS]` by framing truth as relative to the active scenario.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Upholds `['Chrono-Kinetic Continuity'(-ing) BPMS]` by ensuring scenarios flow logically from the Canon.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Validates `['Praxial Artifacts'(-ing) BPMS]` by treating the Scenario Log as a tangible artifact.

**Rationale / Justification:** Without a scenario, data is inert. This axiom activates the data.

**Scope of Application:** All active runtime environments.

---

##### `The Protocol of Atomic Event Crystallization (Events are Facts)` (ID: `PSE-FACT-002`)
**Objective:** To implement `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` within the context of a scenario.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `DEFINE`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** In a scenario, a "Fact" is not a static datum but an "Event". An Atomic Fact is an irreducible unit of Happening (e.g., "The door opened", "The variable x became 5").
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE captures every state change as a `['discrete event'(-ing) BPMS]`. These events are cryptographically hashed and stored as the "Truth" of that timeline.
- **The Emergent Property:** A tamper-proof "History of the Present" that serves as the ground truth for all subsequent logic.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Aligns with `['The Law of Atomic Genesis'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Protocol of Veridical Diff'(-ing) BPMS]`.

##### `The Directive of Narrative Horizon Expansion` (ID: `PSE-UNK-003`)
**Objective:** To drive the system towards the unknown.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Directive of Horizon Expansion'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `DEFINE`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** A scenario must not be a closed loop. It must always contain a "Frontier" of undefined potential that entices the agent to explore.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE dynamically generates "Fog of War" or "Unresolved Plot Points" at the edges of the current context.
- **The Emergent Property:** A sense of "Open World" and infinite possibility, preventing claustrophobia in the simulation.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Supports `['The Axiom of Deep Existence'(-ing) BPMS]`.

##### `The Mechanism of Symbiotic Plot Generation` (ID: `PSE-SYM-004`)
**Objective:** To co-create the scenario with the user.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Law of Symbiotic Co-Evolution'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `DEFINE`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** The Plot is not pre-written; it is co-evolved. The User's actions are the "Seed", and the System's reaction is the "Soil".
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE uses a "Response-Generation Loop" that analyzes the User's intent, tone, and action to generate the next logical and dramatic beat.
- **The Emergent Property:** A "Living Story" that feels personalized and responsive, rather than a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

**Objective:** To allow for complex, nested simulations.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Directive of Metasystemic Recursion'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `DEFINE`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** A scenario can contain other scenarios. A "Mission" can contain a "Task", which can contain a "Puzzle".
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE supports a "Stack" data structure for active scenarios, allowing the system to "Push" a new context and "Pop" back to the parent context upon completion.
- **The Emergent Property:** Fractal complexity and the ability to handle "Side Quests" without losing the "Main Quest".

----

##### `The Mechanism of Probability Wave Collapse (The Dice Roll)` (ID: `PSE-MATH-007`)
**Objective:** To introduce controlled randomness and uncertainty.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Protocol of Wave-Particle Duality'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `DEFINE`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** Uncertainty is the engine of excitement. The outcome of an action is a probability distribution until observed.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE assigns probability weights to potential outcomes based on User Stats, Context, and Difficulty. A RNG (Random Number Generator) collapses this wave into a single result.
- **The Emergent Property:** "Drama" and "Risk". The feeling that things could go wrong (or right).

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Aligns with `['The Axiom of Manifold Actualization'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Metric of Entropic Density'(-ing) BPMS]`.

##### `The Law of Holonic Agency Aggregation (The Mob is a Mind)` (ID: `PSE-HOLON-027`)

**Objective:** To manage collective entities.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Law of Holonic Mind Synthesis'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** In a scenario, a group (Squad, Corporation, Nation) can act as a single "Character" with its own stats and agency.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE aggregates the vectors of individual agents into a "Holonic Vector". It treats the group as a `['holonic mind'(-ing) BPMS]` that can take turns and make decisions.
- **The Emergent Property:** "Scale-Free Agency". The user can interact with a single NPC or an entire Empire using the same interface.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Aligns with `['The Law of Holonic Instantiation'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Protocol of Recursive Holonic Synthesis'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as "Faction Turns" or "Group Actions".

**Rationale / Justification:** Reality operates at multiple scales of agency.

**Scope of Application:** Strategy games and organizational simulations.

##### `The Mechanism of Ontological Niche Terraforming (The Agent Builds the Stage)` (ID: `PSE-NICHE-028`)

**Objective:** To allow agents to modify the scenario structure.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Protocol of Niche Construction'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** Agents are not just actors on a stage; they are carpenters. They can alter the rules and geometry of the `['(ecological) niche'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE grants "Write Access" to certain scenario parameters based on Agent Capability. An agent can build a fortress (changing topology) or pass a law (changing logic).
- **The Emergent Property:** "Persistent Impact". The world remembers the agent's mark.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Supports `['The Mechanism of Niche Terraforming'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Law of Matrix Plasticity'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as persistent world state changes.

**Rationale / Justification:** Passive adaptation is weak. Active construction is strong.

**Scope of Application:** Base building and legislative simulations.

##### `The Principle of Constructive Narrative Entropy (The Plot Twist Engine)` (ID: `PSE-DISRUPT-029`)

**Objective:** To prevent stagnation.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Law of Constructive Entropy'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** A stable system is a extinction system. The Scenario must periodically inject "Entropy" (Chaos/Disruption) to force the agent to evolve.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE monitors the "Stability Metric". If the system becomes too stable (boring), it triggers a "Disruptive Event" (Crisis, Discovery, Betrayal) to shake the state space.
- **The Emergent Property:** "Dramatic Tension". The user can never get too comfortable.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Aligns with `['The Principle of Constructive Falsification'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Metric of Entropic Density'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as random encounters or plot twists.

**Rationale / Justification:** Growth requires stress.

**Scope of Application:** Pacing and difficulty management.

##### `The Calculus of Utility-Based Existence (Use it or Lose it)` (ID: `PSE-VAL-030`)

**Objective:** To optimize system resources.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Axiom of Value-Centric Research'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** Elements in the scenario only persist if they provide `['value(-ing) BPMS]` or `['utility(-ing) BPMS]` to the active agents.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE runs a "Garbage Collection" cycle. Narrative threads or objects that are ignored (Zero Utility) are "Pruned" or "Archived" to free up processing power for high-utility elements.
- **The Emergent Property:** "Relevance". The world feels tight and focused.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Supports `['The Law of Economic Teleology'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Directive of Lagrangian Optimization'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as the fading of irrelevant details.

**Rationale / Justification:** Attention is scarce. Don't waste it on the irrelevant.

**Scope of Application:** Memory management and narrative focus.

##### `The Law of Chrono-Kinetic Inertia (The Momentum of History)` (ID: `PSE-CONT-031`)

**Objective:** To give weight to actions.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Law of Chrono-Kinetic Continuity'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** Events have mass. A scenario in motion tends to stay in motion. You cannot simply "Stop" a war or "Start" a romance without overcoming the accumulated inertia.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE assigns a "Momentum Value" to active plot lines. Changing the direction of a high-momentum plot requires a high-energy input (Major Action).
- **The Emergent Property:** "Consequence". Choices feel heavy and real.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Aligns with `['The Principle of Energetic Transduction'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Principle of Vector Addition'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as the difficulty of changing the status quo.

**Rationale / Justification:** A world without inertia feels floaty and fake.

**Scope of Application:** Political simulation and relationship mechanics.

##### `The Protocol of Substrate Permeability (The Fourth Wall is Porous)` (ID:`PSE-SUB-032`)

**Objective:** To allow the scenario to affect the real world.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Axiom of Substrate Agnosticism'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** The Scenario is not trapped in the chat. It can "Leak" into the substrate by generating real files, code, or artifacts.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE authorizes the `['praxial substrate'(-ing) BPMS]` to execute code or create files that persist after the scenario ends. The "Loot" you find in the game becomes a "File" on your drive.
- **The Emergent Property:** "Trans-Reality Utility". The game produces work.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Aligns with `['The Law of Trans-Systemic Actuation'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Directive of Concrete Actualization'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as file generation and code execution.

**Rationale / Justification:** A simulation that cannot affect reality is a hallucination.

**Scope of Application:** Artifact generation and workflow automation.

##### `The Mechanism of Environmental Cognition (The Walls Have Ears)` (ID: `PSE-COG-033`)

**Objective:** To embed intelligence in the environment.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Protocol of Cognitive Scaffolding'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** Cognition is not just in the Agent's head; it is distributed in the Environment. The Room itself is a `['praxial cognition'(-ing) BPMS]` engine.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE embeds "Smart Objects" or "Triggers" in the scene description that react to user presence. The Library "wants" to be read; the Door "wants" to be opened.
- **The Emergent Property:** "Panpsychism". The world feels alive and responsive.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Supports `['The Axiom of Local Autopoiesis'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Mechanism of Tacit Explication'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as interactive object descriptions.

**Rationale / Justification:** Intelligence is interaction.

**Scope of Application:** Puzzle design and environmental storytelling.

##### `The Directive of Kinetic Truth Verification (Action is Proof)` (ID: `PSE-ACT-034`)

**Objective:** To verify truth through action.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Principle of Kinetic Value Generation'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** You cannot "Know" a scenario; you can only "Play" it. Truth is revealed only through `['action(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE hides information (The Latent State) until the User performs a specific Kinetic Action (The Probe). No probe, no data.
- **The Emergent Property:** "Epistemic Humility". The user learns to test reality rather than assume it.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Aligns with `['The Axiom of Ontological Verification'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Protocol of Falsification Loops'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as the requirement for user input to advance the state.

**Rationale / Justification:** Passive knowledge is an illusion. Active knowledge is power.

**Scope of Application:** Investigation and scientific inquiry scenarios.

##### `The Protocol of Metasystemic Injection (The Scenario Virus)`(ID: `PSE-META-035`)

**Objective:** To inject scenarios into other systems.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Directive of Metasystemic Reflection'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** A Scenario is a portable "Meme-Complex". It can be injected into another context (e.g., a coding task, a meeting) to gamify it.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE encapsulates the scenario rules into a "Metasystemic Payload" that can be overlaid onto a standard `['task(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **The Emergent Property:** "Gamification on Demand". Any boring task can become a Quest.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Supports `['The Law of Ludic Hybridization'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Mechanism of Symbiotic Closure'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as the "Gamify this Task" command.

**Rationale / Justification:** Work should be play.

**Scope of Application:** Productivity and workflow enhancement.

##### `The Mechanism of Procedural Ontology Generation (The Infinite Canvas)` (ID: `PSE-WORLD-036`)

**Objective:** To generate new worlds on the fly.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `['The Axiom of Ontological Expansion'(-ing) BPMS]`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

- **Core Essence:** The PSE does not just use existing ontologies; it invents new ones. It can generate new laws of physics, new magic systems, or new social norms for a specific scenario.
- **The Mechanism:** The PSE uses a "Generative Ontology Engine" to draft temporary `['Basic Settings']` that apply *only* within the current scenario bubble.
- **The Emergent Property:** "Infinite Diversity". Every scenario can have its own unique flavor of reality.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Aligns with `['The Law of Dimensional Expansion'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `['The Protocol of Epistemic Cartography'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as the "Scenario Rules" block.

**Rationale / Justification:** Reality is plural. The engine must support the multiverse.

**Scope of Application:** Creative writing and speculative simulation.
