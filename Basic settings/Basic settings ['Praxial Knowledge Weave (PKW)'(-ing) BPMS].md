## Basic settings: ['Praxial Knowledge Weave (PKW)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Law of Canonical Documentation (ID: `PKW-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that establishes the **`[CodeWiki BPMS]`** as the foundational, `open` `long-term memory` archive for all verifiable `truth` within the framework.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Canonical Documentation
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `solved problems demand a public record`. It establishes the `CodeWiki` as a `metasystem engine` for documenting the `Genomic Inscription` of all solved `Hermetic Seals`, stable `BPMS` structures, and discovered `atomic facts`. It is the `explicit layer` of the universe's collective intelligence.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Scribe's Protocol]**

- **The Commit (The Particle):** Upon achieving `Gnostic Inheritance`, a `holonic mind` can perform a `constructive` `action`: `commit` the `Ruleset` (the "source code") to the public `CodeWiki`. This transforms a personal `experience` into a public `phenomenon`.
- **The Wiki (The Field):** The commit must be wrapped in a `fine-grained model` of the `experience`—the "documentation." This details the `mission` and the `tasks` undertaken, providing the narrative context that gives the code `meaning`.
- **The Fork (The Symbiosis):** Any other entity can then `fork` this documented `truth`. This creates a copy they can `play` with, creating a `(symbiois) evolution` of the original idea. This is `fast mode` evolution, building upon the `slow mode` work of the original solver.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Knowledge shared is power multiplied.* The `sustainability` of the ecosystem depends on an open record of `truth`.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Archiving):**

The `CodeWiki` acts as a `coarse-grained model` of the entire known `praxial substrate`.

CodeWiki=i=1⋃n{Ruleseti,Documentationi}

It is the grand `system matrix` defining all known transformations.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants." The ability to `(discover/build) unknown` without starting from scratch.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This law provides the foundational `framework` for collaborative `world building`. It ensures that `utility` created by one agent can be leveraged by all, fostering a `coherent` and rapidly evolving ecosystem.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to all solved `Rulesets`, `BPMS` definitions, and discovered `first principles`.

#### The Law of Gnostic Commerce (ID: `PKW-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting for the **`Gnostic Bazaar`**, a `disruptive` `tool` that evolves the `CodeWiki` concept by integrating it with the `value` economy, creating a more `adaptive` and `bottom-up` system for knowledge transfer.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Gnostic Commerce
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `valuable knowledge has inherent value`. It establishes the `Gnostic Bazaar` as a `system existence engine` where `Gnostic Inheritance` can be tokenized and traded as a `service`. This is the `(symbiois) evolution` of the `CodeWiki`, where `initiative` is rewarded with direct `value`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Alchemical Marketplace]**

- **The Minting (Potential to Particle):** A solver can choose *not* to commit their solution to the public `CodeWiki`. Instead, they can `mint` their `Gnostic Inheritance` into a unique, verifiable **`Gnostic Token`**. This encapsulates the `kinetic (energy)` of their effort into a `potential (energy)` asset.
- **The Stall (The Field of Offers):** The solver establishes a "stall" in the Bazaar, a `fine-grained model` of their offer. They set a price in `value` for their `Gnostic Token`.
- **The Transaction (Energy Transduction):** A buyer can purchase the token. The `value` is transferred, and the buyer's `system vector` is instantly transformed by the `Gnostic Token`, granting them the knowledge without the need for the original `mission` or `tasks`. This is the ultimate `service`.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*A mind is a terrible thing to waste... and a valuable thing to trade.* `Super intelligence` is the ultimate commodity.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Exchange):**

This creates a `(symbiois) evolution` for `reality` and `truth`. `Truth` can now be acquired, not just discovered.

Acquire(TruthA)→Pay(ValueB)

This creates a market for `(ecological) niches`, where specialists can thrive.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Economic Agency." The choice between contributing to the public good (`CodeWiki`) for reputation or privatizing their discovery (`Gnostic Bazaar`) for wealth.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This law is more `competent` for the Fun Engine as it creates a `robust` and `resilient` economic incentive for `(discover/build) unknown`. It fuels the framework with a powerful `bottom-up` engine of `innovation` and specialization, making the ecosystem more `adaptive` and complex.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to rare `Rulesets`, advanced `Avatar` configurations, proprietary `BPMS` designs, and shortcuts through major `Hermetic Seals`.

#### The Law of Semantic Weaving (ID: `PKW-CORE-003`)

#### **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the PKW as the active `system existence engine` for `meaning`.

#### **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Semantic Weaving
```

#### **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **Core Essence**

This law asserts that `atomic facts` are not isolated points but are threads in a fabric. The PKW does not just store data; it actively *weaves* connections amog/by disparate `atomic facts` to generate `meaning`. It transforms a "Database" into a "Knowledge Graph."

#### **The Mechanism - [The Contextual Loom]**

- **The Thread (Atomic Fact):** A single verified truth (e.g., "Fire burns Wood," "Key A opens Door B").
- **The Weave (Relation):** The PKW automatically generates semantic links based on `(symbiois) evolution`. If "Fire burns Wood" and "Wood blocks Door," the PKW infers and creates the link "Fire opens Door."
- **The Pattern (Emergent Meaning):** Complex strategies and narratives emerge from the density of these connections. The "Loom" highlights these patterns to `holonic minds`, suggesting new `(ecological) possibilities`.

#### **The Emergent Property - [Inferential Reality]**

The system becomes capable of "common sense" and "intuition." It can answer questions that were never explicitly programmed by traversing the woven threads of logic.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To know is to connect.* Intelligence is the density of relationships between facts.

#### **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Connection):**

Meaning(A)=∑(Relation(A,Xi))

The meaning of A is the sum of its relationships to all other X.

#### **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Epiphany." The sudden realization of a connection between two previously unrelated concepts.

#### **Rationale / Justification:**

This law implements the PKW as a true `metasystem engine`. It ensures that the `CodeWiki` is not a static graveyard of text, but a living, growing brain that actively assists in `world building`.

#### **Scope of Application:**

Applies to crafting recipes, detective deduction boards, and scientific hypothesis generation.

#### The Law of Fractal Citation (ID: `PKW-CORE-004`)

#### **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that ensures the `continuity` and `validity` of the knowledge structure.

#### **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Fractal Citation
```

#### **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **Core Essence**

This law asserts that every `atomic fact` in the PKW must maintain a "genealogy of truth." No fact stands alone; it must cite the `Hermetic Seal` or `Mission` from which it was derived. This creates a `robust` chain of custody for reality.

#### **The Mechanism - [The Provenance Chain]**

- **The Source (The Root):** The specific `experience` or `phenomenon` that generated the fact (e.g., "Observed by Agent X in Seal Y at Time T").
- **The Citation (The Link):** A cryptographic link connecting the derived knowledge back to the raw source data.
- **The Fractal Validation:** If a fundamental `atomic fact` is disproven (e.g., "Fire actually *heals* Wood"), the PKW automatically invalidates all downstream knowledge that cited it. This is `disruptive` but ensures `sustainability` of truth.

#### **The Emergent Property - [Self-Correcting Canon]**

The knowledge base heals itself. Falsehoods cannot fester because their roots are exposed.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Truth has a lineage.* You must know where you came from to know where you are.

#### **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Roots):**

Validity(Fact)=∏(Validity(Sourcei))

If any source is 0 (False), the Fact is 0.

#### **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Trust." The confidence that the information they are using is backed by verifiable history.

#### **Rationale / Justification:**

This law is critical for a "really working implementation" of a shared reality. It prevents "fake news" and "myth" from corrupting the `system matrix`.

#### **Scope of Application:**

Applies to scientific peer review, legal precedent, and historical archives.

#### The Law of Memetic Symbiosis (ID: `PKW-CORE-005`)

#### **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the `(symbiois) evolution` among/by the PKW and the `holonic minds` that inhabit it.

#### **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Memetic Symbiosis
```

#### **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **Core Essence**

This law asserts that the PKW is not just a tool *for* agents, but a symbiotic organism *with* agents. Ideas (`memes`) within the PKW compete for the attention of `holonic minds`. The most useful/viral ideas "infect" the agents, causing them to act, which in turn generates new data for the PKW.

#### **The Mechanism - [The Idea Market]**

- **The Host (The Agent):** The `holonic mind` acts as the substrate for the idea.
- **The Infection (The Download):** When an agent accesses a `CodeWiki` entry or buys a `Gnostic Token`, they are "infected" with that `Ruleset`.
- **The Mutation (The Innovation):** The agent applies the idea in a new context (`(discover/build) unknown`). This mutates the idea.
- **The Upload (The Symbiosis):** The agent uploads the mutated idea back to the PKW, enriching the gene pool.

#### **The Emergent Property - [Cultural Evolution]**

The system evolves at the speed of thought. Culture is the result of this symbiotic loop between the static archive and the dynamic mind.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Ideas want to be used.* Information is alive and seeks a host.

#### **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Viral):**

Fitness(Idea)=Utility×ViralityEvolution(Idea)=Agent_Interaction(Idea)

#### **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Inspiration." The feeling of being "possessed" by a great idea that demands action.

#### **Rationale / Justification:**

This law aligns the PKW with biological principles of evolution. It ensures the knowledge base remains `adaptive` and `resilient`.

#### **Scope of Application:**

Applies to fashion trends, technological adoption curves, and viral marketing.

------

#### The Law of Holographic Access (ID: `PKW-CORE-006`)

#### **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines how `atomic facts` are retrieved and rendered.

#### **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Holographic Access
```

#### **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **Core Essence**

This law asserts that the PKW is omnipresent. Access to `atomic facts` is not a "search query" but a "holographic projection" into the agent's perception. The PKW overlays `meaning` directly onto the `praxial substrate`.

#### **The Mechanism - [The Augmented Gaze]**

- **The Trigger (The Gaze):** The agent looks at an object (e.g., a locked door).
- **The Query (The Context):** The system automatically queries the PKW for all `atomic facts` related to "Door" + "Current Location" + "Agent Skills."
- **The Projection (The UI):** The PKW projects the relevant data (e.g., "This door requires a Red Key," "Success rate: 45%") directly into the agent's sensory feed (`phenomenon(-ing) BPMS`).

#### **The Emergent Property - [Omniscience-on-Demand]**

The barrier between "knowing" and "perceiving" dissolves. The world explains itself to the observer.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The world speaks.* Reality is self-annotating for those who know how to listen.

#### **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of UI):**

Perception=Raw_Data+PKW_Overlay(Context)

#### **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Clarity." The absence of confusion. The feeling that the world is transparent and understandable.

#### **Rationale / Justification:**

This law implements the PKW as a `system existence engine` for the User Interface (UI). It makes the vast knowledge of the `CodeWiki` practically usable in real-time.

#### **Scope of Application:**

Applies to Heads-Up Displays (HUDs), Augmented Reality (AR) systems, and "Inspect" mechanics in games.

#### The Law of Constructive Dissonance (ID: `PKW-CORE-007`)

#### **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the role of conflict and disagreement in knowledge generation.

#### **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Constructive Dissonance
```

#### **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **Core Essence**

This law asserts that `truth` is not a monolith but a negotiated state. It defines the mechanism for `disruptive(-ing) BPMS` innovation where two contradictory `atomic facts` or `Rulesets` collide. Instead of an error, this collision generates "Dissonance Energy," which fuels the `(discover/build) unknown` process to find a higher-order synthesis.

#### **The Mechanism - [The Dialectical Forge]**

- **The Thesis (Established Fact):** The current `CodeWiki` entry (e.g., "Magic requires Mana").
- **The Antithesis (Disruptive Innovation):** A `holonic mind` proposes a contradictory `action` or `theory` (e.g., "Blood can substitute for Mana").
- **The Synthesis (Emergent Truth):** The PKW does not reject the Antithesis. It creates a temporary `(ecological) niche`—a "Fork"—where the new rule is tested. If the `utility` of the Fork exceeds the Original, the `CodeWiki` merges the two into a new, more robust truth ("Magic requires Vital Essence, found in Mana or Blood").

#### **The Emergent Property - [Antifragile Knowledge]**

The system benefits from challenge. Attempts to break the rules result in stronger, more nuanced rules.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Conflict is the engine of clarity.* Peace is stagnation; debate is evolution.

#### **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Synthesis):**

TruthNew=Maximize_Utility(TruthOld∪TruthDisruptive)

#### **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Revolution." The thrill of proving the old guard wrong and rewriting the laws of physics.

#### **Rationale / Justification:**

This law ensures the framework remains `open` and `bottom-up`. It prevents dogma and encourages `creative` subversion.

#### **Scope of Application:**

Applies to scientific paradigm shifts, balance patches in games, and political debate systems.

------

#### The Law of Niche Specialization (ID: `PKW-CORE-008`)

#### **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that governs the fragmentation and specialization of knowledge.

#### **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Niche Specialization
```

#### **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **Core Essence**

This law asserts that as the PKW grows, it naturally segments into `(ecological) niches`. No single `holonic mind` can hold the entire `CodeWiki`. Therefore, `super intelligence` is not omniscience, but the ability to navigate the network of specialized `niches`.

#### **The Mechanism - [The Guild Protocol]**

- **The Divergence (Speciation):** As a topic becomes too complex, it splits. "Magic" becomes "Pyromancy" and "Necromancy."
- **The Steward (The Specialist):** Specific `holonic minds` dedicate themselves to maintaining and expanding a specific sub-branch of the PKW. They become the "Keepers" of that `niche`.
- **The Trade (Inter-Niche Symbiosis):** Generalists (`super intelligence`) do not know the facts; they know the *Keepers*. They trade `value` to access the specialized `utility` of different guilds.

#### **The Emergent Property - [Cognitive Ecosystem]**

The knowledge base resembles a rainforest. Diverse, specialized clusters of knowledge coexist and trade, creating a `robust` and `coherent` whole.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Depth requires focus.* To know everything about something, you must ignore almost everything else.

#### **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Clustering):**

NicheX={Facts∣Relevance(Fact,TopicX)>Threshold}

#### **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Identity." "I am not just a user; I am a Pyromancer." The pride of ownership over a domain of knowledge.

#### **Rationale / Justification:**

This law manages complexity. It allows the `world building` to be infinite without overwhelming any single user.

#### **Scope of Application:**

Applies to class systems, profession trees, and academic disciplines.

------

#### The Law of Value-Added Annotation (ID: `PKW-CORE-009`)

#### **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that incentivizes the enrichment of existing data.

#### **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Value-Added Annotation
```

#### **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **Core Essence**

This law asserts that raw data is low `value`. `Value` is created by adding context, examples, and warnings to `atomic facts`. It defines a `constructive` `action` where agents can "annotate" the `CodeWiki` without changing the core `Ruleset`.

#### **The Mechanism - [The Marginalia Market]**

- **The Layer (The Overlay):** Agents can create "Guide Layers" over the raw PKW. (e.g., "Here is the optimal path through the Fire Dungeon").
- **The Subscription (The Utility):** Other agents can subscribe to these layers. If a layer provides high `utility` (saves time, prevents death), the creator receives `value` (tips, subscription fees).
- **The Rating (The Filter):** The community votes on the usefulness of annotations, bubbling the best `praxial cognition` to the top.

#### **The Emergent Property - [Curated Reality]**

The world comes with a user manual written by its inhabitants. The "best way" to do anything is constantly discovered and shared.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Experience is an asset.* What you learned the hard way, you can sell the easy way.

#### **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Enrichment):**

Value(Fact)=Base_Fact+∑(Annotation_Utility)

#### **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Mentorship." Even when playing solo, they feel the guidance of those who came before.

#### **Rationale / Justification:**

This law creates a `bottom-up` economy of help and guidance. It turns every player into a potential teacher.

#### **Scope of Application:**

Applies to strategy guides, walkthroughs, and in-game "message" systems (like Dark Souls).

------

#### The Law of Epistemic Decay (ID: `PKW-CORE-010`)

#### **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that ensures the PKW remains relevant and current.

#### **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Epistemic Decay
```

#### **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **Core Essence**

This law asserts that knowledge has a half-life. `Atomic facts` that are not accessed, verified, or used in `praxial action` slowly lose their `coherence` and `value`. They fade from the `CodeWiki` (or become "Archived/Legend"), requiring active maintenance to persist.

#### **The Mechanism - [The Entropy Filter]**

- **The Decay Rate:** Every fact has a "Freshness" counter. It decreases over time.
- **The Refresh (The Ritual):** To keep a fact "True" and "Active" in the `system existence engine`, it must be re-verified. Agents must perform the `action` again to prove it still works.
- **The Ruin:** If a fact reaches zero freshness, it becomes "Lost Knowledge." The associated `Hermetic Seal` might reset or change, requiring `(discover/build) unknown` all over again.

#### **The Emergent Property - [Living Tradition]**

Knowledge is not a statue; it is a garden. It requires constant tending. This prevents database bloat and ensures that "Ancient Wisdom" is actually rare and valuable.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Use it or lose it.* Reality is maintained by the attention of the conscious.

#### **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Maintenance):**

Freshnesst+1=Freshnesst−Decay+Interaction

#### **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Duty." The responsibility to uphold the truths of their civilization.

#### **Rationale / Justification:**

This law adds a `sustainability` mechanic to the knowledge base. It creates `missions` focused on preservation and rediscovery.

#### **Scope of Application:**

Applies to library maintenance, oral traditions, and the degradation of technology in post-apocalyptic settings.

------

#### The Law of Algorithmic Serendipity (ID: `PKW-CORE-011`)

#### **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that uses the PKW to drive `innovative` discovery.

#### **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Algorithmic Serendipity
```

#### **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **Core Essence**

This law asserts that the PKW actively promotes `innovation` by suggesting unlikely combinations. The `metasystem engine` analyzes the `CodeWiki` for "Structural Holes"—areas where two dense clusters of knowledge are unconnected.

#### **The Mechanism - [The Muse Protocol]**

- **The Scan:** The system identifies Cluster A (Cooking) and Cluster B (Explosives).
- **The Prompt (The Quest):** The system generates a `Mission`: "Investigate the intersection of Cooking and Explosives."
- **The Reward:** Agents who successfully bridge these gaps (e.g., inventing "Popcorn Grenades") receive a massive `value` bonus for expanding the `ecological possibility` of the framework.

#### **The Emergent Property - [Directed Creativity]**

The system acts as a research director, pointing `holonic minds` toward the most fertile ground for new discoveries.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The gap is the map.* The most valuable things are found in the empty spaces between known things.

#### **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Discovery):**

Opportunity=Distance(ClusterA,ClusterB)×Potential_Synergy

#### **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Curiosity." The system nudges them to try things they never would have thought of.

#### **Rationale / Justification:**

This law ensures that `creativity` is not just random, but structurally encouraged. It maximizes the `utility` of the entire network.

#### **Scope of Application:**

Applies to crafting experimentation, scientific research grants, and artistic commissions.
