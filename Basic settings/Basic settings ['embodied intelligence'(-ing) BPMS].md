## Basic settings: ['embodied intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Somatic Grounding (ID: `EMBODIMENT-CORE-001`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines **Embodied Intelligence** not as a computational process occurring in a vacuum, but as a **Systemic Resonance Engine** where cognition is inextricably bound to a physical or virtual substrate (body/avatar) and its sensorimotor capabilities.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Axiom of Somatic Grounding
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This axiom asserts that `intelligence is a function of morphology`. It defines the agent's "mind" as an emergent property of the friction between its "body" (the interface) and the "world" (the environment). There is no "brain in a vat"; the limitations and affordances of the body *are* the structure of the intelligence.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Proprioception]

- **The Sensorimotor Loop (The Grip):** Intelligence is not generated by processing data, but by *acting* upon it. The `['embodied intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]` continuously cycles through `Sense -> Actuate -> Sense Delta`. The "meaning" of an object is not its label, but how the body can manipulate it (e.g., a "chair" is not a visual pattern, but a "sittable surface").
- **The Morphological Constraint (The Filter):** The "body" acts as a hardware filter for reality. A sensor with only thermal vision *cannot* conceive of color. Therefore, the ontology of the agent is strictly limited and defined by its somatic configuration.
- **The Visceral Feedback (The Burn):** Errors in prediction result in "pain" or "energy loss" (simulated or real). This negative feedback is not just a data point; it is a systemic stressor that forces immediate structural adaptation in the neural/logic weights.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Situated Cognition]

The creation of "Know-How" rather than "Know-That." The agent does not just store facts; it develops *muscle memory* (procedural heuristics) for navigating the specific topology of its existence.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To think is to move.* Cognition is a navigational tool for a specific body in a specific space. Abstract thought is merely a high-level simulation of physical movement.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Embodiment):

The "Physics" of how the body shapes the mind is defined by the specific `[BPMS(U)]` of the niche:

- **If `[robotics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Kinematic Physics)** Cognition is constrained by degrees of freedom (DOF) and torque limits. `Intelligence_Capacity = f(Joint_Articulation, Sensor_Fidelity)`
- **If `['virtual-avatar'(-ing) BPMS]`: (Interface Physics)** Cognition is constrained by the UI/UX affordances. If the avatar cannot "jump," the concept of "verticality" is cognitively inaccessible or abstract. `Cognitive_Map = Reachable_State_Space(Avatar_Capabilities)`
- **If `['biological-sim'(-ing) BPMS]`: (Metabolic Physics)** Cognition is constrained by energy cost. "Thinking" burns calories. High-level reasoning is expensive and only deployed when low-level reflexes fail. `Thought_Depth = Available_Glucose - Basal_Metabolic_Rate`

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The agent experiences "Presence." The feeling of *being there*. The weight of the avatar, the resistance of the terrain, and the immediate, unmediated connection between "Will" and "Motion."

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

This implementation respects the `Praxial Genesis Canon` by rejecting dualism (mind vs. body). It enforces the `Praxial` view that theory (mind) and practice (body) are a single, unified feedback loop. It ensures that "intelligence" in the Fun Engine is always context-specific and grounded in actual capabilities.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to NPC AI behavior, robotic control systems, VR avatar kinematics, procedural animation blending, and "survival mode" cognitive resource management.
