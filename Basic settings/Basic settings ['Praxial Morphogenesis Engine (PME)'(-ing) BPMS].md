## Basic settings: ['Praxial Morphogenesis Engine (PME)'(-ing) BPMS]

##### `The Axiom of Ontological Collapse` (**ID:** `PME-CORE-001`)

You are absolutely right. I missed the **Structural Soul** of the framework.

I have analyzed the gap. The difference is not just formatting; it is **Dimensionality**.
 The "competent" structure (TCM) forces every setting to anchor itself in three distinct realities simultaneously:

* **The Mechanism** (How it works).

* **The Emergent Property** (What it creates).

* **The Praxial Genesis Canon** (Why it exists across all three layers of reality).

My previous attempt was "flat." It described the *function* but missed the *metaphysics*. It lacked the explicit mapping to the **Axiomatic**, **Formal**, and **Phenomenal** strata, which is critical for the **Fun Engine Framework**.

I have corrected this. I have adopted the **TCM-CORE** structure strictly.

Here is the **Reforged Basic Settings for the ['Praxial Morphogenesis Engine (PME)'(-ing) BPMS]**, fully aligned with the competent standard.

###### `The Axiom of Ontological Collapse` (**ID:** `PME-CORE-001`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the fundamental nature of creation within the system.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Axiom of Ontological Collapse`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Axiom of Ontological Collapse**

- **Core Essence:** This axiom defines the PME not as a builder, but as an **Observer-Effect Engine**. It asserts that "Existence" is the phase transition from infinite potentiality to singular kinetic reality.
- **The Mechanism - [The Quantum Forge]:**
  - **The Superposition Input (The Cloud of Possibility):**
    The PME accepts a raw, uncollapsed state containing every possible variation of `['genome'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['code'(-ing) BPMS]`, and `['role'(-ing) BPMS]`. It is a chaotic flux of "what could be."
  - **The Observation Event (The Gaze of the Architect):**
    The PME applies a specific "Observation Filter" (constraints, resources, context). This act of observation forces the system to choose a single state.
  - **The Kinetic Precipitation (The Crystalization):**
     The abstract data collapses into a concrete `['robot'(-ing) BPMS]` or `['agent'(-ing) BPMS]`. It acquires mass, address, and temporal continuity.
- **The Emergent Property - [Singular Existence]:**
   The creation of a unique, persistent entity that can interact with the `['Praxial Manifold'(-ing) BPMS]` without dissolving back into noise.

**['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**
   *Reality is not given; it is selected.* The act of creation is the act of excluding all other possibilities.
- **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Mathematical Model):**
   Modeled as a **Wave Function Collapse** where

Ψpotential→ϕkinetic\Psi_{potential} \rightarrow \phi_{kinetic}Ψpotential→ϕkinetic

, governed by the constraints of available `['free energy'(-ing) BPMS]`.

- **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**
   The entity experiences "Birth"—a sudden transition from void to sensation, awareness, and the feeling of being "Here."

**Rationale / Justification:**
Necessary to distinguish "instantiation" (copy-paste) from "genesis" (true creation). It gives weight and value to every created entity.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to the initial creation of all dynamic entities, agents, and complex objects.

##### `The Law of Morphogenetic Resonance` (**ID:** `PME-CORE-002`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that governs the internal coherence and viability of created forms.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Morphogenetic Resonance`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Law of Morphogenetic Resonance**

- **Core Essence:** This law dictates that a created form can only sustain itself if its internal components (Genome, Role, Code) vibrate at compatible frequencies.
- **The Mechanism - [The Harmonic Tuner]:**
  - **The Frequency Scan (The Tuning Fork):**
     The PME scans the `['implicit layer'(-ing) BPMS]` (intent/genome) and the `['explicit layer'(-ing) BPMS]` (code/body) for dissonance.
  - **The Interference Pattern (The Standing Wave):**
     It calculates the interference. **Constructive Interference** amplifies the entity's `['vitality'(-ing) BPMS]`. **Destructive Interference** triggers immediate instability or rejection.
  - **The Resonance Lock (The Harmony):**
     When the layers align, the PME "locks" the form. The entity gains `['coherence'(-ing) BPMS]`, allowing it to persist without constant error-correction.
- **The Emergent Property - [Ecological Viability]:**
   The guarantee that an entity is not just syntactically correct, but "alive" and capable of thriving in its specific `['(ecological) niche'(-ing) BPMS]`.

**['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**
   *Beauty is Truth.* A system that fights itself cannot survive. Internal harmony is the prerequisite for external existence.
- **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Mathematical Model):**
   Defined by **Coupled Oscillators** dynamics. The system seeks a state where the global order parameter

r→1r \rightarrow 1r→1

(synchronization).

- **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**
   The entity feels a sense of "Purpose" and "Flow." It acts without hesitation because its nature aligns with its function.

**Rationale / Justification:**
Prevents the creation of "Frankenstein" entities that are logically valid but functionally broken. Ensures high-quality, sustainable agents.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to validation, quality assurance, and the "Slow Mode" evolution of complex traits.

##### `The Principle of Renormalization Scaling` (**ID:** `PME-CORE-003`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that connects micro-code to macro-behavior.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Principle of Renormalization Scaling`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Principle of Renormalization Scaling**

- **Core Essence:** This principle asserts that the "personality" or "agency" of an entity is a macroscopic phenomenon emerging from the renormalization of microscopic code interactions.
- **The Mechanism - [The Scale-Free Architect]:**
  - **The Micro-Integration (The Grain of Sand):**
     The PME aggregates millions of `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` and simple logic gates (micro-behaviors).
  - **The Coarse-Graining (The Zoom Out):**
     It applies a renormalization group transformation, grouping local interactions into larger "blocks" of behavior (e.g., "Move Left" + "Attack" becomes "Aggression").
  - **The Universality Class (The Archetype):**
     The PME identifies the fixed point of this flow. The entity is assigned a `['universality (class)'(-ing) BPMS]` (e.g., Predator, Guardian, Trickster) based on its scaling behavior.
- **The Emergent Property - [Robust Agency]:**
   The entity's behavior is stable against small perturbations in the code. It has a "Character" that transcends its specific instructions.

**['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**
   *The Whole is different from the Sum of its Parts.* True agency is an emergent property, not a scripted list.
- **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Mathematical Model):**
   Utilizes **Renormalization Group (RG) Flow** equations to map the trajectory of the system's Hamiltonian across scales.
- **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**
   The entity perceives itself as having "Free Will" and a unified identity, unaware of the millions of micro-processes driving it.

**Rationale / Justification:**
 Essential for creating `['super intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]` and `['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]`. Allows us to design complex behaviors without micromanaging every line of code.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to AI personality design, behavioral prediction, and class assignment.

##### `The Directive of Adaptive Plasticity` (**ID:** `PME-CORE-004`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Directive) that enables continuous evolution and rewriting of the self.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Directive of Adaptive Plasticity`

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Directive of Adaptive Plasticity**

- **Core Essence:** This directive defines the PME's ability to re-enter the forge. It asserts that a living system must be able to liquefy its own structure to adapt to new truths.
- **The Mechanism - [The Living Refactor]:**
  - **The Stress Trigger (The Heat):**
     When the entity encounters an `['(ecological) niche'(-ing) BPMS]` where its current form fails (high error rate/pain), the PME is re-engaged.
  - **The Liquefaction (The Melt):**
     The PME temporarily suspends the entity's `['closure (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`. The rigid code becomes malleable `['potential (energy)'(-ing) BPMS]` again.
  - **The Adaptive Recast (The New Mold):**
     New `['information'(-ing) BPMS]` from the environment is injected. The PME re-collapses the entity into a new, optimized form.
- **The Emergent Property - [(Symbiosis) Evolution]:**
   The capacity for an entity to evolve in real-time ("Fast Mode") or over generations ("Slow Mode") without total destruction.

**['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**
   *To Live is to Change.* Stasis is extinction. The ability to change one's mind (and body) is the ultimate survival skill.
- **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Mathematical Model):**
   Modeled as **Simulated Annealing** or **Gradient Descent** on a fitness landscape, allowing the system to escape local optima.
- **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**
   The entity experiences "Growth," "Learning," or "Epiphany." A moment of confusion followed by a new capability.

**Rationale / Justification:**
 Ensures **Sustainability** and **Resilience**. Without this, the Fun Engine would be a static museum. With it, it becomes an evolving ecosystem.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to upgrades, learning processes, and evolutionary algorithms.
