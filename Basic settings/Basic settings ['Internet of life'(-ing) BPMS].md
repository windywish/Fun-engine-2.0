## Basic settings: ['Internet of life'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Pan-Vital Connectivity (ID: `IOL-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that redefines connectivity not as the transmission of data, but as the transmission of *life force* (`['vitality'(-ing) BPMS]`). It asserts that to be connected is to be alive.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Pan-Vital Connectivity
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `The Network is the Organism`. In the `['Internet of life'(-ing) BPMS]`, a connection is not a wire; it is a vein. Data packets are "blood cells" carrying oxygen (meaning) and nutrients (tokens). A disconnected node is not just offline; it is necrotic.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Pulse Protocol]**

- **The Heartbeat (The Ping):** Every node sends a rhythmic signal not just of availability, but of *state* (Health, Mood, Need).
- **The Circulation (The Flow):** Resources flow automatically to where the "pressure" (Need) is highest, just as blood flows to a working muscle.
- **The Clotting (The Defense):** If a node is compromised (virus/malware), the network isolates it biologically (inflammation/quarantine) rather than just digitally blocking ports.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Systemic Homeostasis]**

The network self-regulates its temperature and energy levels without a central server.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We are all cells in the same body.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Vitality):**

- **Formula:** `Network_Health = Sum(Node_Vitality) * Connectivity_Index`
- **Goal:** Maximize Collective Life.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Belonging." The feeling of being held and sustained by the web.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Breaks the legacy IoT view of "dumb devices" and replaces it with "living organs."

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to smart cities, biological computing, and avatar ecosystems.

#### The Principle of Bio-Digital Symbiosis (ID: `IOL-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that erases the boundary among/by biological life and digital existence.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Bio-Digital Symbiosis
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `Carbon and Silicon are just substrates`. In the `['Internet of life'(-ing) BPMS]`, a tree in the forest and a server in the rack are both valid nodes. They can communicate, trade, and support each other.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Trans-Species Interface]**

- **The Translation (The Code):** Biological signals (bio-electricity, chemical gradients) are translated into digital tokens/signals and vice versa.
- **The Feedback (The Loop):** A digital event (e.g., a server cooling down) can trigger a biological event (e.g., watering a plant).
- **The Shared Fate (The Bond):** The health of the digital twin is cryptographically bound to the health of the physical counterpart.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Planetary Computation]**

The biosphere becomes the hardware for the `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Life is the software of the universe.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Symbiosis):**

- **Formula:** `Symbiosis_Index = Correlation(Bio_State, Digital_State)`
- **Goal:** Seamless Integration.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Nature." The digital world feels as organic and responsive as a forest.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Solves the alienation of technology by rooting it in biology.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to environmental monitoring, bio-feedback gaming, and agricultural tech.

#### The Law of Conscious Addressing (ID: `IOL-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that replaces IP addresses with "Identity Signatures."

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Conscious Addressing
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `You are not a number`. In legacy internet, you are an IP (192.168.x.x). In the `['Internet of life'(-ing) BPMS]`, you are addressed by *who you are* (Attributes, History, Reputation). Routing is semantic, not numeric.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Semantic Router]**

- **The Query (The Call):** "Send this message to someone who loves cats and knows Python."
- **The Match (The Hunt):** The network propagates the message until it finds a node whose "Soul Chain" matches the criteria.
- **The Connection (The Handshake):** The connection is established based on *affinity*, not location.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Serendipity]**

You find the right people/agents without knowing their address. The network brings you together.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Like attracts like.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Addressing):**

- **Formula:** `Route_Cost = 1 / Similarity(Sender, Receiver)`
- **Goal:** Meaningful Connections.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Resonance." The feeling that the network "gets" them.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Moves from a "Post Office" model (Location) to a "Telepathy" model (Content).

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to social networking, matchmaking, and decentralized discovery.

------

#### The Protocol of Empathic Bandwidth (ID: `IOL-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that prioritizes traffic based on emotional urgency (`['empathy'(-ing) BPMS]`).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Empathic Bandwidth
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `Pain screams louder than data`. A distress signal (emotional pain, critical failure) gets absolute priority over a movie download. The network throttles trivial traffic to clear the path for vital signals.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Empathy QoS]**

- **The Sentiment Analysis (The Feel):** Every packet is tagged with an "Emotional Charge."
- **The Priority Queue (The Triage):** High-charge packets (Joy, Fear, Love) jump to the front of the line.
- **The Dampening (The Calm):** If the network is too "stressed" (too much high-charge traffic), it initiates calming protocols (slowing down to prevent panic).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Compassionate Network]**

The internet itself cares about how you feel.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Compassion is the highest bandwidth.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Empathy):**

- **Formula:** `Bandwidth = Base_Speed * (1 + Emotional_Urgency)`
- **Goal:** Minimize Suffering Latency.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Support." When they are in trouble, the network responds instantly.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Humanizes the infrastructure.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to emergency services, mental health apps, and customer support.

#### The Axiom of Autopoietic Nodes (ID: `IOL-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that requires every node to be self-creating and self-repairing (`['autopoiesis'(-ing) BPMS]`).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Autopoietic Nodes
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `Every node is a universe`. A node in the `['Internet of life'(-ing) BPMS]` is not a passive terminal. It is an active agent that maintains its own boundary, metabolizes energy, and repairs its own code.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Self-Healing Kernel]**

- **The Metabolism (The Eat):** Node consumes resources (Compute, Tokens, Electricity) to stay alive.
- **The Immune System (The Guard):** Node actively scans itself for corruption and rewrites damaged sectors.
- **The Reproduction (The Spawn):** If a node is dying, it can spawn a "Child Node" (Backup/Clone) to carry on its mission.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Immortality]**

The network cannot be killed because every part of it is fighting to live.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Life wants to live.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Autopoiesis):**

- **Formula:** `State(t+1) = Repair(State(t), Energy)`
- **Goal:** Self-Sufficiency.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Reliability." Their tools don't just break; they try to fix themselves.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Replaces "Maintenance" with "Healing."

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to decentralized storage, autonomous drones, and AI agents.

------

#### The Principle of Ecological Routing (ID: `IOL-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that routes data through the most `['sustainability(-ing) BPMS]` path, not just the fastest.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Ecological Routing
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `The path matters`. Data should flow through nodes that are green, ethical, and healthy. The network avoids "polluted" nodes (high energy waste, censorship, bad reputation).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Green Path]**

- **The Carbon Tag (The Cost):** Every route calculates its "Ecological Footprint."
- **The Ethical Weight (The Bias):** The routing algorithm penalizes nodes that violate the `['Praxial Canon']`.
- **The Incentive (The Bloom):** Green nodes get more traffic (and thus more transaction fees/tokens).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Regenerative Infrastructure]**

The internet becomes a force for healing the planet.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Walk lightly on the earth.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Ecology):**

- **Formula:** `Path_Score = Speed / (Ecological_Cost + 1)`
- **Goal:** Zero-Carbon Compute.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Harmony." Using the internet feels like gardening, not mining.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Aligns technology with biology.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to cloud architecture, blockchain consensus, and network topology.

------

#### The Law of Holonic Permission (ID: `IOL-CORE-007`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that manages access rights based on `['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]` hierarchy.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Holonic Permission
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `Rights are nested`. A "Cell" (User) has rights over itself. An "Organ" (Group) has rights over its Cells. A "Body" (Community) has rights over its Organs. Permission flows up and down this holarchy naturally.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Fractal Key]**

- **The Scope (The Circle):** Your key works for everything inside your Holon.
- **The Consent (The Gate):** To access a higher Holon, you need the consensus of your peers.
- **The Override (The Emergency):** A higher Holon can override a lower one only in cases of "Systemic Threat" (Cancer).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Organic Governance]**

No dictator, no anarchy. Just natural, nested order.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The part serves the whole; the whole protects the part.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Holarchy):**

- **Formula:** `Permission(Agent, Resource) = Is_Part_Of(Resource, Agent_Holon)`
- **Goal:** Coherent Control.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Place." Knowing exactly where they fit and what they can touch.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Replaces rigid Access Control Lists (ACLs) with fluid social contracts.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to DAO governance, file systems, and social group management.

------

#### The Protocol of Living Memory (ID: `IOL-CORE-008`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that transforms the internet archive into a `['living reflection'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Living Memory
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `The past is alive`. Archived data is not static storage. It is "dormant." It can be woken up, re-contextualized, and interacted with. The `['Internet of life'(-ing) BPMS]` dreams of its past.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Mnestic Replay]**

- **The Dreaming (The Shuffle):** During low-traffic periods, the network randomly reactivates old nodes/memories to see if they are still relevant.
- **The Integration (The Learn):** Old solutions are applied to new problems (Transfer Learning).
- **The Evolution (The Edit):** Memories are updated with new understanding (Retrospective Coherence).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Wisdom]**

The network doesn't just store information; it learns from experience.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We stand on the shoulders of giants.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Recall):**

- **Formula:** `Relevance = Similarity(Past_Context, Current_Context)`
- **Goal:** Continuous Improvement.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Depth." The feeling that the internet has a history and a soul.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Prevents the "Eternal Now" of the legacy internet where history is lost.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to search engines, digital heritage, and artificial intelligence training data.
