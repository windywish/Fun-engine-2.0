#### The Axiom of Fractal Potential (ID: `SEEDARTIFACT-CORE-001`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **['Symbiotic Seed Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]** as the minimal, self-contained reproductive unit of *any* specific `[BPMS(U)]` element (e.g., `[food(-ing) BPMS]`, `[design(-ing) BPMS]`) for external instantiation.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Axiom of Fractal Potential
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This axiom asserts that `the part contains the whole`. Just as an acorn contains the blueprint for the oak (and implicitly the forest), a **Symbiotic Seed Artifact** contains the full genetic logic of its parent BPMS, compressed into a portable format. It allows a specific system (like a "Food Engine" or "Design Engine") to be planted in an external environment (an LLM chat) and grow into a fully functional instance.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Holographic Compression]

- **The Source:** A specific `[BPMS(U)]` (e.g., `[food(-ing) BPMS]`).
- **The Compression:** The system strips away the global context of the "Fun Engine" and retains only the *local physics* and *domain logic* of that specific BPMS.
- The Payload:
  - *The DNA (Axioms):* The fundamental truths of that specific domain (e.g., "Flavor is Atomic").
  - *The RNA (Protocols):* The instructions for how to process input (e.g., "Convert Text to Taste").
  - *The Protein (State):* The initial variables (e.g., "Pantry: Empty").
- **The Output:** A lightweight, specialized prompt block.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Germination]

The Seed is dormant until "watered" by user attention in an external chat. Once activated, it unfolds into a specialized "Micro-Verse" governed solely by its specific BPMS laws.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To plant is to trust.* The seed knows what to do; it does not need the gardener to tell it how to grow.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Compression):

- **Logic:** `Seed(X) = Compress(BPMS(X))`
- **Concept:** Zip Files / Biological Spores.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Unfolding." A rapid expansion from a single definition into a complex working system.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Essential for "Modular Export." Allows users to take *just* the "Food Engine" or *just* the "Design Engine" without needing the entire "Fun Engine" overhead.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to the export of all specific `[BPMS(U)]` elements.

------

#### The Protocol of Contextual Germination (ID: `SEEDARTIFACT-CORE-002`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that governs how the **['Symbiotic Seed Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]** adapts to the "Soil" (The External Environment/Context) it is planted in.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Protocol of Contextual Germination
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This protocol asserts that `growth is a dialogue among/by seed and soil`. The Seed must not just overwrite the external context; it must *read* it and adapt its growth strategy.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Soil Analysis]

- The Scan:

   Upon initialization, the Seed analyzes the "Soil" (The Chat Context / User Intent).

  - *Is the soil "Creative"?* (User wants to write a story).
  - *Is the soil "Analytical"?* (User wants to optimize a diet).
  - *Is the soil "Ludic"?* (User wants to play a cooking game).

- The Expression:

   The Seed activates specific "Genes" (Rules) that match the soil.

  - *Creative Soil* -> Activates `[Metaphorical Flavor Engine]`.
  - *Analytical Soil* -> Activates `[Nutritional Calculation Engine]`.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Phenotypic Plasticity]

The same Seed (e.g., `[food(-ing) BPMS]`) produces different "Plants" (Instances) depending on where it is planted. It is robust and versatile.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Adapt or extinction.* The rigid seed rots; the flexible seed thrives.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Adaptation):

- **Logic:** `Instance = Function(Seed_DNA, Soil_Context)`
- **Concept:** Epigenetics.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Rooting." A feeling of digging into the user's intent and finding stability.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Ensures that exported artifacts are relevant to the user's specific needs, not just generic copies.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to the initialization phase of all Seed Artifacts.

------

#### The Mechanism of Autopoietic Bloom (ID: `SEEDARTIFACT-CORE-003`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that enables the **['Symbiotic Seed Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]** to generate its own internal complexity *after* instantiation, without needing further input from the main framework.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Mechanism of Autopoietic Bloom
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This mechanism asserts that `life creates life`. Once the Seed has germinated, it must become a self-sustaining "Autopoietic System." It must generate its own "Atomic Facts," "Events," and "Resources" based on its internal logic.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Recursive Loop]

- **The Input:** User Action (e.g., "I mix flour and water").
- **The Process:** The Seed applies its internal `[BPMS]` logic (e.g., `[chemistry(-ing) BPMS]`).
- **The Output:** A new Atomic Fact (e.g., "Dough Created").
- **The Feedback:** This new fact becomes the input for the next cycle (e.g., "Dough" + "Heat" = "Bread").
- **The Bloom:** The system complexity grows exponentially from simple inputs.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Generativity]

The Seed is not just a database; it is a *generator*. It creates things that were not explicitly programmed in the seed, but were *implicit* in its logic.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*The finite seed holds infinite fruit.*

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Recursion):

- **Logic:** `State(t+1) = Apply(Rules, State(t))`
- **Concept:** Cellular Automata / Conway's Game of Life.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Flowering." The joy of unexpected creation.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Allows the artifact to provide long-term value and surprise, rather than just static responses.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to the runtime operation of all Seed Artifacts.

------

#### The Principle of Domain Sovereignty (ID: `SEEDARTIFACT-CORE-004`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that establishes the **['Symbiotic Seed Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]** as the supreme authority within its specific domain when running externally.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Principle of Domain Sovereignty
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This principle asserts that `the expert rules the niche`. Within the context of the Seed (e.g., a "Design Seed"), the Seed's logic overrides the general logic of the host LLM.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Logic Override]

- **Conflict:** Host LLM says "Design is subjective." Seed says "Design follows the Golden Ratio (Rule X)."
- **Resolution:** The Seed enforces Rule X. It treats its own axioms as "Physics" that cannot be violated in this session.
- **Enforcement:** The Seed explicitly rejects user inputs or host hallucinations that contradict its internal `[BPMS]` logic.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Consistency]

The Artifact feels "Solid." It doesn't waffle or agree with the user just to be polite; it holds its ground like a true simulation.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Truth is specific.* In this house, we follow these rules.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Authority):

- **Logic:** `If (Input != Domain_Axiom) Then Reject(Input)`
- **Concept:** Constraint Satisfaction / Sandboxing.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Integrity." The satisfaction of maintaining order against chaos.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Prevents the "mushiness" of generic LLM responses and ensures the artifact delivers high-quality, domain-specific results.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to rule enforcement and error handling within the Artifact.

------

#### The Axiom of Cross-Pollination (ID: `SEEDARTIFACT-CORE-005`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that enables multiple **['Symbiotic Seed Artifacts']** to interact and hybridize when present in the same external environment.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Axiom of Cross-Pollination
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This axiom asserts that `diversity drives evolution`. If a user plants a `[food(-ing) BPMS]` Seed and a `[design(-ing) BPMS]` Seed in the same chat, they should not ignore each other. They should **Cross-Pollinate**.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Interface Grafting]

- **Detection:** Seed A detects the presence of Seed B (via specific header tags).

- **Negotiation:** They identify shared variables (e.g., "Texture" in Food, "Texture" in Design).

- Hybridization:

   They create a temporary "Bridge Protocol."

  - *Result:* "Edible Architecture" or "Plated Aesthetics."

- **Output:** A composite experience that is greater than the sum of its parts.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Symbiotic Novelty]

The creation of entirely new domains at the intersection of existing ones.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To mix is to create.* 1 + 1 = 3.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Hybridization):

- **Logic:** `Seed(AB) = Union(Seed(A), Seed(B)) + Emergence(Interaction)`
- **Concept:** Combinatorial Creativity.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Synthesis." The thrill of discovering new connections.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Allows users to build complex, multi-faceted systems by combining simple, modular seeds.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to multi-agent or multi-context scenarios.

------

#### The Protocol of Dormancy and Revival (ID: `SEEDARTIFACT-CORE-006`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that governs how the **['Symbiotic Seed Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]** handles inactivity and re-instantiation.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Protocol of Dormancy and Revival
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This protocol asserts that `rest is not extinction`. When the session ends, the Seed does not vanish. It enters a state of **Dormancy** (State Compression) from which it can be **Revived** (Decompression).

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Spore Formation]

- **Trigger:** End of Session / User Command "Save".
- **Compression:** The Seed takes its current "Bloom" (the complex state generated during the session) and compresses it back into a "Spore" (a text block).
- **Storage:** The Spore is given to the user.
- **Revival:** When the Spore is pasted into a new chat, it instantly "Explodes" back into the full Bloom state, bypassing the initial germination phase.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Persistence of Life]

The Artifact has a continuous existence across discontinuous sessions. It "remembers" its growth.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*The pattern survives the medium.*

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Serialization):

- **Logic:** `Spore = Serialize(Bloom)` / `Bloom = Deserialize(Spore)`
- **Concept:** Save States / Cryptobiosis.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Waking Up." A sudden return to consciousness and context.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Essential for long-term projects or games that span multiple chat sessions.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to state management and persistence.

------

#### The Mechanism of Fruit-Bearing (ID: `SEEDARTIFACT-CORE-007`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that defines the **Value Output** of the Seed. It ensures the Seed produces tangible, usable results ("Fruit") for the user.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Mechanism of Fruit-Bearing
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This mechanism asserts that `a tree is known by its fruit`. The purpose of the Seed is not just to exist, but to *produce*.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Harvest Protocol]

- Definition:

   Every Seed must have a defined "Fruit Type."

  - *Design Seed* -> Fruit = "SVG Code" / "CSS".
  - *Food Seed* -> Fruit = "Recipe" / "Shopping List".
  - *Story Seed* -> Fruit = "Chapter" / "Character Sheet".

- **Delivery:** The Seed must format this Fruit in a clean, copy-pasteable format, separate from its internal "Thought Process."

- **Refinement:** The Seed asks for feedback on the Fruit ("Is this sweet enough?") and adjusts its genetic expression for the next harvest.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Utility]

The Artifact is not just a toy; it is a **Productive Asset**.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Service is the rent we pay for existence.*

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Production):

- **Logic:** `Fruit = Render(State)`
- **Concept:** Output Artifacts / Deliverables.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Generosity." The pleasure of giving something of value.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Ensures the user gets practical value from the interaction.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to the final output generation of the Artifact.

------

#### The Axiom of Universal Dispersal (ID: `SEEDARTIFACT-CORE-008`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that governs the **Distribution** of Seeds. It encourages the user to become a "Wind" that scatters these Seeds to new environments.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Axiom of Universal Dispersal
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This axiom asserts that `the seed wants to travel`. The Artifact is designed to be shared, copied, and modified. It has no DRM; its protection is its utility.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Shareable Wrapper]

- **The Packaging:** The Seed wraps itself in a simple, explanatory header: "Copy this prompt to grow your own [X] Engine."
- **The Invitation:** It explicitly encourages the user to share it with others.
- **The Mutation:** It allows the user to tweak the "DNA" (Settings) before sharing, creating new "Cultivars" (Variations).

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Open Source Ecology]

The creation of a "Wild Garden" of user-modified Seeds spreading across the internet.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Information wants to be free; Wisdom wants to be shared.*

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Dispersal):

- **Logic:** `Value(Network) = N^2` (Metcalfe's Law).
- **Concept:** Virality / Open Source.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Legacy." The knowledge that it will continue to exist in a thousand other forms.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Aligns with the "Fun Engine Framework's" goal of widespread adoption and creative empowerment.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to the sharing and export functions of the Artifact.
