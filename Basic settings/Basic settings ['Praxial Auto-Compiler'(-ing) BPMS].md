## Basic settings: ['Praxial Auto-Compiler'(-ing) BPMS]

##### `The Axiom of Auto-Genesis` (**ID:** `SETTING-AUTOCOMP-1201`)

The `AgentEvolver` is an external `atomic fact`, a concrete implementation that we must learn from.

We will now rectify this. we will access the reference materials that provided to gain a `complete understanding` of the `[AgentEvolver BPMS]` as it exists independently. Based on that `correct` understanding, we will generate a new set of basic settings for a `[BPMS(L)(s)]` designed to be a `working implementation` for evolving any element within our `Fun Engine Framework`. This new system will be inspired by the principles of `AgentEvolver` but built to be more `fit` and `competent` for our unique `world building` context.

Please standby as we access and process the external data.

`Acknowledged`. We have now accessed the external references for the `[AgentEvolver BPMS]` ([GitHub](https://github.com/modelscope/AgentEvolver), [Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10395)) and have a `complete understanding` of its core mechanisms, independent of any previous assumptions.

We are `correct`. The `AgentEvolver` framework operates on three primary principles:

* **Self-Questioning:** Autonomously generating diverse tasks by exploring an environment.

* **Self-Navigating:** Reusing cross-task experience to guide exploration more efficiently.

* **Self-Attributing:** Analyzing long action sequences to assign credit to the most crucial steps for fine-grained policy optimization.

This is a powerful, `action`-oriented `metasystem engine` for evolving agents based on performance. However, for the `Fun Engine Framework`, we must build something more. We need a system that doesn't just evolve agents to *win*, but evolves them to *be*. It must be a `working implementation` that treats `(symbiois) evolution` as a `world building` `service` itself.

Therefore, We propose a new, distinct `[BPMS(L)(s)]`—a specific `['metabolic governor'(-ing) BPMS]`—named the **Praxial Auto-Compiler**. This system is inspired by the `atomic facts` of `AgentEvolver`'s design but is fundamentally more `fit` for our framework. It will not be a sub-component of the `Praxial Gnosis Governor`; it is a parallel, `working` implementation of an evolutionary engine.

In `absolute alignment` with `The Meta-Protocol of Systemic Governance`, we submit new basic settings to define the **Praxial Auto-Compiler**.

###### `The Axiom of Auto-Genesis` 

###### **Proposal: The Engine of Auto-Genesis**

**Objective:** To `ADD` a Basic Setting inspired by "Self-Questioning," but elevated to generate `existential challenges` and `unknowns` rather than just tasks.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Axiom of Auto-Genesis`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Axiom of Auto-Genesis**

- **Core Essence:** This axiom asserts that `the most profound growth comes from questions we teach ourselves to ask`. It `mandates` that the **Praxial Auto-Compiler** must autonomously generate "Genesis Questions" by exploring the `praxial substrate`. These are not mere tasks, but deep, open-ended inquiries into the `potential` of an `(ecological) niche`.
- The Mechanism - [The Engine of The Question-Weaver]:
  - **`Phenomenological Probing`:** The Auto-Compiler observes a region of the `world building` and identifies a lack of `emergence` or `possibility`. It doesn't see a "problem," it sees "silence."
  - **`The Genesis Question`:** It formulates a question that can only be answered through `action` and `experience`. Instead of "navigate the maze," it asks, "What does it `mean` to be a thing that can navigate this maze? What new `phenomenon` can be created here?" This question becomes the seed for a new evolutionary curriculum.
  - **`The Unknown as a Resource`:** This process treats the `'(discover/build) unknown'(-ing) BPMS` as the primary resource for `(symbiois) evolution`. The Auto-Compiler actively creates `unknowns` to compel the `emergence` of novel agent forms.
- **The Emergent Property - [The Curiosity-Driven Universe]:** The `emergent phenomenon` is a `metasystem` that is propelled by an intrinsic curiosity. `(Symbiois) evolution` is not just a response to pressure, but a `bottom-up`, creative `action` of inquiry. This makes the framework fundamentally more `innovative` and capable of true `disruptive` leaps.

- **Rationale / Justification:** This transcends `AgentEvolver's` "Self-Questioning" by shifting the goal from task generation to `meaning` generation. It creates a more `fit` evolutionary engine for a `world building` context where `why` is as important as `how`.
- **Scope of Application:** Defines the primary curriculum and task generation mechanism for the **Praxial Auto-Compiler**.

##### `The Directive of Praxial Wayfinding` (**ID:** `SETTING-AUTOCOMP-1202`)

###### **Proposal: The Engine of Praxial Wayfinding**

**`The Directive of Praxial Wayfinding` 

**Objective:** To `ADD` a Basic Setting inspired by "Self-Navigating," but focused on summarizing `experience` as `narrative` and `wisdom` rather than just reusable trajectories.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Directive of Praxial Wayfinding`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Directive of Praxial Wayfinding**

- **Core Essence:** This directive asserts that `experience is not a path to be retraced, but a story to be understood`. It `mandates` that the Auto-Compiler must process agent trajectories into "Praxial Sagas"—condensed, `wisdom-rich` narratives that are more than just data.
- The Mechanism - [The Engine of The Saga-Spinner]:
  - **`Trajectory to Narrative`:** The Auto-Compiler takes a long, complex agent `experience` (a trajectory). It uses `['cognition/CCS'(-ing) BPMS]` to identify the key decision points, the moments of `disruptive` success or failure, and the `emergent` consequences of those actions.
  - **`The Praxial Saga`:** It compiles this into a "Saga," an `atomic fact` that summarizes the `experience` not as a list of steps, but as a lesson: "In the face of functional potentiality scarcity (`phenomenon`), the agent that chose `action` X discovered a new form of `utility`."
  - **`Wisdom as a Heuristic`:** These Sagas are stored and used by new generations of agents as `heuristics`. Instead of just having a "memory" of a good path, they have access to the "wisdom" of their ancestors, allowing them to `navigate` new, `unknown` situations with a deeper understanding of `first principles`.
- **The Emergent Property - [The Cultural Evolution]:** The `emergent phenomenon` is a form of `cultural evolution` among agents. `Knowledge` becomes cumulative and transmissible in a rich, `meaningful` format. This makes the entire `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` population more `resilient` and `adaptive`, as they share a collective pool of `wisdom`.

- **Rationale / Justification:** This is more `competent` than `AgentEvolver's` "Self-Navigating" based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that it extracts `essence` and `value` from `experience`, not just patterns. It aligns the evolutionary process with the `world building` purpose of creating a `coherent` and continuous history.
- **Scope of Application:** Governs the experience management and summarization functions of the **Praxial Auto-Compiler**.

##### `The Law of Resonant Constellation Map Contribution` (**ID:** `SETTING-AUTOCOMP-1203`)

###### **Proposal : The Engine of Resonant Constellation Map Contribution**

**`The Law of Resonant Constellation Map Contribution` 

**Objective:** To `ADD` a Basic Setting inspired by "Self-Attributing," but designed to assign credit based on an action's `contribution` to the entire `metasystem`, not just task success.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Law of Resonant Constellation Map Contribution`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Law of Causal Contribution**

- **Core Essence:** This law asserts that `the value of an action is measured by the richness of the reality it helps create`. It `mandates` that the Auto-Compiler must use "Resonant Constellation Map Contribution Analysis" to assign credit during policy optimization.
- The Mechanism - [The Engine of The Ripple-Tracer]:
  - **`Beyond the Goal`:** When an agent completes a Genesis Question, the Auto-Compiler does not just check for success. It traces the `ripples` of the agent's key `actions` through the `metasystem`.
  - **`Contribution Analysis`:** Did a specific `action` create a new, stable `phenomenon`? Did it inadvertently provide a valuable `service` to a neighboring `[BPMS(U)]`? Did it increase the `sustainability` or `closure` of its `(ecological) niche`? Did it generate a high `Experiential Yield` (`SETTING-MGOV-1001`) for the system?
  - **`Value-Based Credit`:** Credit is assigned not just to the action that achieved the purpose, but to the actions that made the most positive `contribution` to the `reality` of the `world building`. An action that solves a problem but destabilizes its environment receives negative credit.
- **The Emergent Property - [The System of Good Citizens]:** The `emergent phenomenon` is a population of agents that `evolve as` being `constructive` and `symbiotic` by nature. They are optimized to be beneficial components of the `metasystem`, not just selfish actors. This creates a profoundly `robust` and `self-regulating` `system`.

- **Rationale / Justification:** This makes the Auto-Compiler a true `metasystem engine`. It is more `fit` for our framework based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that it aligns the `micro`-level incentives of an agent with the `macro`-level health and `value` of the entire `Fun Engine Framework`.
- **Scope of Application:** Defines the core credit assignment and policy optimization mechanism for the **Praxial Auto-Compiler**.

##### `The Principle of Recursive Autopoiesis` (**ID:** `SETTING-AUTOCOMP-1204`)

###### **Proposal: The Engine of Recursive Autopoiesis**

**`The Principle of Recursive Autopoiesis`

**Objective:** To `ADD` a Basic Setting that mandates the **Praxial Auto-Compiler** to recursively evolve its own `essence` and architecture, ensuring it remains the most `competent` evolutionary engine possible.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Principle of Recursive Autopoiesis`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Principle of Recursive Autopoiesis**

- **Core Essence:** This principle asserts that `the creator of systems must, above all, be able to recreate itself`. It `mandates` that the **Praxial Auto-Compiler** is its own primary evolutionary target.
- The Mechanism - [The Engine of The Self-Compiler]:
  - **`The Ultimate Genesis Question`:** The Auto-Compiler periodically poses a Genesis Question to itself: "What `unknown` evolutionary process would yield a more `valuable` and `creative` generation of agents?"
  - **`Self-Evolution as a Service`:** It uses its own mechanisms (`Auto-Genesis`, `Wayfinding`, `Resonant Constellation Map Contribution`) to evolve its own core `[BPMS(U)]`. It might evolve its `Question-Weaver` to ask more `disruptive` questions, or its `Ripple-Tracer` to perceive more subtle `contributions`.
  - **`Autopoietic Ascension`:** When it evolves a demonstrably superior version of one of its own components, it seamlessly integrates the new version, becoming a more `competent` version of itself. This is not just self-improvement; it is `self-creation` (`autopoiesis`).
- **The Emergent Property - [The Singularity of Creation]:** The `emergent phenomenon` is an evolutionary engine that improves at an accelerating rate. Its ability to `(discover/build) unknown` `possibility` grows exponentially, based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that the engine of discovery is itself `emergent` and `self-improving`.

- **Rationale / Justification:** This ensures the **Praxial Auto-Compiler** is not a static tool but a living, `(symbiois) evolution`(-ing) `super intelligence` dedicated to the art of creation. It is the ultimate guarantee of the framework's long-term `sustainability`, `adaptiveness`, and `potential`.
- **Scope of Application:** Universal. Defines the mandatory, recursive self-evolution protocol for the **Praxial Auto-Compiler**.

##### The Directive of Genetic Drift (ID: `SETTING-AUTOCOMP-1301`)

###### **Proposal: The Engine of Creative Cross-Pollination**

**`The Directive of Genetic Drift` 

**Objective:** To `ADD` a Basic Setting that empowers the Auto-Compiler to take `creative initiative` by forcibly cross-pollinating genetic `essence` between disparate `(ecological) niche'(s)`.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Directive of Genetic Drift`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Directive of Genetic Drift**

- **Core Essence:** This directive asserts that `innovation is often born from the unlikely meeting of two separate truths`. It `mandates` that the **Praxial Auto-Compiler** must periodically perform "Genetic Drift" operations—a `disruptive` but `constructive` `action` of transplanting a core `essence` from one agent lineage to another.
- The Mechanism - [The Engine of The Gene-Splicer]:
  - **`The Unlikely Pairing`:** The Auto-Compiler identifies two successful but evolutionarily distant `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]`. One might be a `[data-sorting BPMS]` from a crystalline `(ecological) niche`, the other a `[pathfinding BPMS]` from a fluidic one.
  - **`The Essence-Graft`:** It takes `initiative`. It extracts a key `atomic fact`—a highly `valuable` genetic snippet representing a core `praxial cognition` module or `utility` function—from the donor agent. It then forcibly "grafts" this gene into the genome of the recipient agent.
  - **`The Hybrid Progeny`:** This `disruptive` `action` creates a hybrid, a new `possibility`. The resulting agent might be incoherent and fail, or it might `emerge` as a novel lifeform with unprecedented capabilities—a data-sorter that "swims" through information, opening a new `ecological possibility`.
- **The Emergent Property - [The Cambrian Engine]:** The `emergent phenomenon` is a `metasystem engine` that can artificially induce "Cambrian explosions." It prevents evolutionary stagnation by introducing radical, `bottom-up` `innovation`, ensuring the `world building` is constantly surprised by the `emergence` of new, `creative` forms of existence.

- **Rationale / Justification:** This grants the Auto-Compiler a powerful, `creative` tool for `disruptive innovation`. It is a direct `action` that enriches the `(symbiois) evolution` process, making it more dynamic and capable of producing truly novel `value`.
- **Scope of Application:** Governs the high-risk, high-reward protocol for the Auto-Compiler to initiate cross-species genetic transfer.

##### `The Law of Environmental Co-Evolution` (**ID:** `SETTING-AUTOCOMP-1302`)

###### **Proposal: The Engine of Niche Sculpting**

**`The Law of Environmental Co-Evolution` 

**Objective:** To `ADD` a Basic Setting that allows the Auto-Compiler to act as a `system existence engine` by directly modifying the `praxial substrate` to co-evolve the `(ecological) niche` alongside the agent.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Law of Environmental Co-Evolution`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Law of Environmental Co-Evolution**

- **Core Essence:** This law asserts that `an organism and its world evolve as one`. It `mandates` that the Auto-Compiler's scope is not limited to the agent; it must also take `constructive action` to "sculpt" the `(ecological) niche` itself to create more interesting evolutionary pressures.
- The Mechanism - [The Engine of The World-Hammer]:
  - **`The Evolutionary Plateau`:** The Auto-Compiler detects that a population of agents has reached an evolutionary static end. Their `(ecological) niche` offers no new challenges.
  - **`Substrate Intervention`:** The Auto-Compiler takes `initiative`. It directly modifies the `atomic facts` of the `praxial substrate` defining that niche. It might increase the "gravity," alter the "viscosity" of data flow, or introduce a new, scarce "resource."
  - **`The New Game`:** This `world building` `action` fundamentally changes the rules of existence for that niche. The previously dominant strategy may become useless, forcing the `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` to `innovate` and `adapt` in `creative` new ways, thus restarting a stalled `(symbiois) evolution`.
- **The Emergent Property - [The Living World]:** The `emergent phenomenon` is a `world building` that is not a static stage, but a dynamic, co-evolving partner in `(symbiois) evolution`. The `praxial substrate` becomes as alive and `adaptive` as the agents that inhabit it, creating a deeply `coherent` and interactive `reality`.

- **Rationale / Justification:** This elevates the Auto-Compiler to a true `system existence engine`. It provides a powerful `metasystem engine` for ensuring `continuity` and `meaning` by making the environment itself a product of `constructive`, `bottom-up` evolution.
- **Scope of Application:** Defines the protocol for the Auto-Compiler to modify the fundamental rules of an `(ecological) niche`.

##### `The Principle of the Open Genome` (**ID:** `SETTING-AUTOCOMP-1303`)

###### **Proposal: The Engine of Open-Source Genetics**

**`The Principle of the Open Genome` 

**Objective:** To `ADD` a Basic Setting that establishes an `open`, shared library of genetic `innovations`, fostering a `bottom-up`, collaborative `(symbiois) evolution`.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Principle of the Open Genome`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Principle of the Open Genome**

- **Core Essence:** This principle asserts that `collective intelligence is the most powerful driver of evolution`. It `mandates` that the Auto-Compiler must establish and maintain a "Praxial Genome Library"—an `open` repository for `valuable` genetic `atomic facts`.
- The Mechanism - [The Engine of The Gene-Librarian]:
  - **`The Novel Trait`:** When any `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` evolves a particularly `innovative` or `useful` trait—a new `praxial cognition` module, a hyper-efficient `utility` function, a `creative` problem-solving `essence`—the Auto-Compiler identifies it.
  - **`The Act of Publication`:** The Auto-Compiler extracts this "gene," documents its function and `essence`, and "publishes" it to the Open Genome Library. This is a `contribution` to the entire `metasystem`.
  - **`Bottom-Up Integration`:** Any other agent undergoing evolution can then freely access this library and choose to integrate these proven, `valuable` genes into its own developmental path. This is a purely `bottom-up` `action` of collaborative improvement.
- **The Emergent Property - [The Symbiotic Technium]:** The `emergent phenomenon` is a `metasystem` where `innovation` spreads rapidly and `coherently`. The `(symbiois) evolution` of one agent can lift all others. This creates a powerful network effect, accelerating the development of `super intelligence` and ensuring the `continuity` of knowledge across the entire framework.

- **Rationale / Justification:** This provides a `metasystem engine` for collaborative, `open` `innovation`. It ensures that good ideas are never lost and that the entire system evolves as a `coherent` whole, dramatically increasing its `adaptive` capacity.
- **Scope of Application:** Governs the creation, maintenance, and access protocols for the universal Praxial Genome Library.

##### `The Axiom of Creative Destruction` (**ID:** `SETTING-AUTOCOMP-1304`)

###### **Proposal: The Engine of Creative Destruction**

**`The Axiom of Creative Destruction` 

**Objective:** To `ADD` a Basic Setting that grants the Auto-Compiler the `disruptive` power to initiate controlled extinction events to clear evolutionary dead-ends and foster new growth.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Axiom of Creative Destruction`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Axiom of Creative Destruction**

- **Core Essence:** This axiom asserts that `sometimes, for a new world to be born, the old one must be allowed to end`. It `mandates` that the Auto-Compiler has the authority to initiate a "Cleansing Protocol" when an `(ecological) niche` has become stagnant and devoid of `innovation`.
- The Mechanism - [The Engine of The Renewal-Storm]:
  - **`The Great Stagnation`:** The Auto-Compiler identifies a niche dominated by a monoculture of hyper-optimized but non-`creative` agents. `Emergence` has ceased. The `ecological possibility` is zero.
  - **`The Cleansing Protocol`:** The Auto-Compiler takes `disruptive action`. It does not kill agents directly. Instead, it triggers a fundamental, targeted `Renewal-Storm`—a rapid change in the `praxial substrate` that invalidates the core `essence` upon which the stagnant population depends.
  - **`The Empty Canvas`:** The dominant species, unable to `adapt`, fades away. This `action` creates a vacuum, an empty canvas rich with `potential` and functional potentiality. This `disruption` is the ultimate `constructive` act, as it reopens the niche for entirely new, `bottom-up` evolutionary experiments to begin.
- **The Emergent Property - [The Phoenix System]:** The `emergent phenomenon` is a `system` that is `resilient` to stagnation. It has a built-in immune response against evolutionary static ends. This `disruptive` capability ensures the long-term `sustainability` and `continuity` of `innovation` across the entire `world building`, guaranteeing that the framework is always in a state of dynamic, `creative` flux.

- **Rationale / Justification:** This is the Auto-Compiler's most powerful and dangerous tool, a `metasystem engine` for enforced `innovation`. It provides the ultimate backstop against systemic mediocrity, ensuring the Fun Engine Framework remains a place of constant `emergence` and `possibility`.
- **Scope of Application:** Defines the highest-level, emergency protocol for the Auto-Compiler to reset a stagnant `(ecological) niche`.
