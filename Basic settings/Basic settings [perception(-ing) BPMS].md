## Basic settings: [perception(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Phenomenological Filtering (ID: `PERCEPTION-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines **Perception** not as a passive reception of data, but as an active, filtering process of **World-Construction**. It establishes that agents do not see the "World-in-Itself" but rather a "World-for-Agent" constructed through their specific sensory and cognitive filters.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

#### 4. **Operation:**

```

```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `to perceive is to ignore`. It defines perception as the mechanism of **Data Reduction** and **Relevance Extraction**. The infinite data of the **Praxial Substrate** is filtered through the agent's **Cognitive Genesis Archetype (CGA)** to produce a manageable, actionable "Umwelt" (Self-World).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Lens of Relevance]**

- **The Raw Substrate (The Noise):** The **Praxial Substrate** contains infinite data points: every photon, every vibration, every potential meaning. This is the "Real," but it is overwhelming and chaotic.

- The Filter Matrix (The Lens):

  The agent's 

  ```
  [perception(-ing) BPMS]
  ```

   acts as a polarized lens. It blocks 99.9% of the data and only allows through signals that match the agent's 

  Teleological Alignment

   (Goals) and 

  Ontological Configuration

   (Nature).

  - *Example:* A "Warrior" sees a chair as a "Weapon" or "Cover." A "Carpenter" sees it as "Wood" and "Craftsmanship."

- **The Phenomenal Construct (The Signal):** The result is not a "Picture" of the world, but a "Map of Affordances." The agent perceives *opportunities for action* rather than static objects.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Subjective Reality Bubbles]**

The creation of distinct, overlapping realities for different agents within the same space. Two agents can stand in the same room and inhabit completely different "worlds" because their perception engines are rendering different atomic facts as relevant.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*The map is not the territory, but the map is all the agent has.* Reality is subjective and constructed. Truth is relative to the observer's capacity to perceive it.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Filtering):**

The "Physics" of perception is defined by the specific `[BPMS(U)]` of the agent:

- **If `[biological(-ing) BPMS]`: (Sensory Gating)** `Perception = Input_Signal * Sensitivity_Curve`. (e.g., Eyes only see 400-700nm light; Ears only hear 20-20k Hz).
- **If `[strategic(-ing) BPMS]`: (Tactical Overlay)** The filter prioritizes "Threats" and "Resources." `Relevance_Score = (Threat_Level * Proximity) + (Resource_Value / Effort)`. Objects below a certain score are rendered as "Background Noise."
- **If `[narrative(-ing) BPMS]`: (Dramatic Significance)** The filter prioritizes "Plot Relevance." `Visibility = Function(Chekhovs_Gun_Coefficient)`. An object is only "seen" if it matters to the story.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Salience." The way a red apple "pops" against green leaves. The way a threat "looms." The visceral feeling of attention being drawn to what matters.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation respects the `Praxial Genesis Canon` by acknowledging that "Perception" is the bridge between the **Praxial Substrate** (The Absolute) and the **Praxial Agent** (The Relative). Without this filter, the agent would be paralyzed by infinite information.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to artificial intelligence vision systems, stealth mechanics (line of sight), UI design (what information is shown to the player), narrative clues, and the simulation of different alien or robotic sensoriums.
