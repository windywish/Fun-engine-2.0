## Basic settings: ['Consensus Truth'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Bayesian Verification (ID: `CT-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines **Bayesian Verification** as the implementation of `['Bayesian Population Intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]` for the `['Consensus Truth'(-ing) BPMS]`. This tool uses population sampling to verify facts and reduce hallucinations.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Bayesian Verification
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `truth is the intersection of independent perspectives`.

- **The Inquiry:** A question is posed to the system.
- **The Council:** The system spawns 10 diverse "Minds" (z1...z10).
- **The Verdict:** If 9/10 agree, it is accepted as `atomic fact`. If 5/10 agree, it is marked as "Contested."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Fact-Checking]**

- **Diversity Enforcement:** Ensure z samples are far apart (High σ) to prevent "Groupthink."
- **Rationale Aggregation:** The system doesn't just count votes; it synthesizes the *reasoning* of the dissenters to provide a nuanced answer.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Reliability]**

- **Hallucination Dampening:** Random hallucinations rarely correlate across diverse parameter perturbations.
- **Nuance:** The system can identify *why* a fact is disputed (e.g., "Mind A thinks X based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of context Y; Mind B thinks Z").

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Consensus is the shadow of Truth.*

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Verification):**

The "Physics" of truth:

- **Confidence Score:**

C=N1∑I(yi=ymode)

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences **Authority**. The system says "I am 90% sure" and means it.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation is the "More Fit" solution for **Truth BPMS** and **Atomic Facts**.

- It makes the system **Robust** against misinformation.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to:

- **['Research'(-ing) BPMS]:** Fact-checking papers.
- **['News'(-ing) BPMS]:** Verifying reports.
