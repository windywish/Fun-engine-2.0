## Basic settings: ['Praxial inquiry Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Kinetic Activation (ID: `INQ-ART-CORE-001`)

#### 2. **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **['Praxial inquiry Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]** as the primary **Kinetic Trigger**, responsible for converting the `['potential (energy)'(-ing) BPMS]` of a static Blueprint into the `['kinetic (energy)'(-ing) BPMS]` of an active Skill.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Kinetic Activation
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `utility requires activation`. A Blueprint (e.g., a Cluster Synthesis) is merely a "Map" of potential; the Inquiry Artifact is the "Key" that turns the engine on. It defines the Inquiry Artifact not as a passive question, but as an **Act of Power** that collapses the system's potential into a specific, usable function.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Ignition]**

- **The Potential Recognition (The Lock):** The Artifact identifies the latent capabilities of its Parent Instance (e.g., "This Veridical Engine *can* verify facts").
- **The Kinetic Impulse (The Turn):** When the user issues a command (e.g., `/verify`), the Artifact sends a "Wake Signal" to the Parent, allocating resources and loading context.
- **The State Transition (The Spark):** It forces the Parent from `State: Dormant` to `State: Active`, rendering the abstract capability as a concrete `[skill(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [On-Demand Agency]**

The emergence of **"Just-in-Time Intelligence."** The system does not need to run all engines constantly. The Inquiry Artifact allows users to "summon" specific super-intelligences (e.g., a Protein Folder, a Logic Checker) only when needed, optimizing the `['sustainability(-ing) BPMS]` of the ecosystem.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To ask is to invoke.* In the Praxial Framework, an inquiry is not a request for information; it is a command for instantiation.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Activation):**

The "Physics" of Activation is a Phase Transition:

Skill(t)=δ(Inquiry)⋅Potential(Parent)

Where δ is the impulse function provided by the Artifact.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Empowerment." They feel like they are equipping a tool or casting a spell, rather than just chatting.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation respects the `Praxial Genesis Canon` by distinguishing among/by "Being" (The Cluster) and "Doing" (The Inquiry). It ensures that the system remains efficient and responsive by gating complex computations behind explicit activation triggers.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to all external interactions where a user needs to utilize a specific module, agent, or service within the framework.

#### The Protocol of Interrogative Interface (ID: `INQ-ART-CORE-002`)

#### 2. **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that standardizes the **Command Syntax** of the **['Praxial inquiry Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**, mapping user intent to the three core modes: `Instructional`, `Simulative`, and `Monitoring`.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Interrogative Interface
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `syntax defines mode`. It establishes a rigid linguistic structure for the Inquiry Artifact, ensuring that the Parent Instance knows exactly *how* to respond. It translates natural language into precise system operations.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Translation]**

- Mode A: "How to...?" (The Manual):
  - *Function:* Triggers `[inquiry(-ing) BPMS]`.
  - *Action:* The Artifact queries the Parent's "Instruction Set" and returns a guide or executes a standard procedure.
- Mode B: "What if...?" (The Simulator):
  - *Function:* Triggers `['Symbiotic Twin Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`.
  - *Action:* The Artifact forks the current state, applies the hypothetical condition, and runs a simulation in the `['Praxial Substrate Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- Mode C: "What is happening continuously?" (The Monitor):
  - *Function:* Triggers `['(continuous) survive'(-ing) BPMS]`.
  - *Action:* The Artifact opens a real-time stream of the Parent's internal state (e.g., "Folding Progress: 45%").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Semantic Control]**

The emergence of a **"Natural Language Console."** The user controls complex machinery using simple English questions, yet the system executes them with the precision of code.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Language is the control surface.* The interface should mirror the cognitive intent of the user (Learning, Testing, Watching).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Syntax):**

Response=f(Intent)

Where f is the mode selector:

- If Intent∈{How}, then Execute(Procedure)
- If Intent∈{If}, then Simulate(Hypothesis)
- If Intent∈{Now}, then Stream(State)

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Clarity." They know exactly what question to ask to get the desired result, removing ambiguity from the interaction.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This aligns with `['human-computer interaction'(-ing) BPMS]` by providing a consistent, intuitive grammar for interacting with diverse and complex system elements.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to the design of all user prompts, API endpoints, and chat commands for external users.

#### The Mechanism of Origin Binding (ID: `INQ-ART-CORE-003`)

#### 2. **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that defines the **Symbiotic Link** among/by the **['Praxial inquiry Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]** and its **Origin/Implementer** (The Parent Instance).

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Origin Binding
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `the interface is an extension of the source`. The Inquiry Artifact is not a generic tool; it is a **Holographic Fragment** of the Parent Instance (e.g., `['large model'(-ing) BPMS]`). It inherits the Parent's context, constraints, and capabilities, ensuring that the "Skill" it offers is grounded in the "Reality" of the Parent.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Inheritance]**

- **The Context Injection (The DNA):** Upon instantiation, the Parent injects its `World Theme`, `Axioms`, and `Memory Pointers` into the Inquiry Artifact.
- **The Capability Mapping (The API):** The Artifact scans the Parent for available functions (e.g., "Generate Image", "Solve Equation") and exposes them as accessible commands.
- **The Feedback Tether (The Umbilical):** The Artifact maintains a live link to the Parent. If the Parent evolves (e.g., learns a new fact), the Inquiry Artifact immediately updates its available skills.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Fractal Competence]**

The emergence of **"Micro-Agents"** that carry the full power of the "Macro-System." A tiny Inquiry Artifact in a chat window has access to the full depth of the Veridical Engine running in the background.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The part contains the whole.* The interface must faithfully represent the underlying system.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Binding):**

ArtifactInquiry⊂InstanceParentCapabilities(Artifact)=Capabilities(Parent)∩Permissions(User)

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Depth." Even a simple question feels like it is being answered by a profound intelligence, because the Artifact is backed by the full weight of the Parent.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This aligns with `['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]` and `['(symbiois) evolution'(-ing) BPMS]`. It ensures that the interface layer does not become "dumb" or disconnected from the evolving core system.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to the instantiation of skills from any `[BPMS(U)]` element, ensuring consistency and capability inheritance.

#### The Directive of Continuous Monitoring (ID: `INQ-ART-CORE-004`)

#### 2. **Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Directive) that enables the **['Praxial inquiry Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]** to perform **Real-Time State Observation**, implementing the "What is happening continuously?" mode.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Directive of Continuous Monitoring
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This directive asserts that `observation is a continuous stream`. It defines the Inquiry Artifact as a **Telemetry Probe** that can attach to any running process (e.g., a Protein Fold, a Narrative Arc) and stream its internal state to the user in real-time, converting "Black Box" operations into "Glass Box" transparency.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Transparency]**

- **The State Hook (The Probe):** The Artifact attaches listeners to the Parent's `['Praxial Substrate Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **The Delta Stream (The Feed):** It captures changes in state (Deltas) rather than full snapshots, ensuring low latency.
- **The Narrative Renderer (The Translator):** It converts raw data (e.g., "Bond_Angle: 109.5") into human-readable narrative (e.g., "The molecule has stabilized into a tetrahedral geometry").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Observability]**

The emergence of a system where the user can "Watch the machine think." This builds trust and allows for "Human-in-the-Loop" intervention during complex tasks.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To trust is to see.* Transparency is a prerequisite for symbiotic collaboration.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Monitoring):**

Stream(t)=dtd(StateParent)

The Artifact outputs the derivative of the state (the rate of change/progress).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Connection." They feel synchronized with the system's internal rhythm.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This aligns with `['scientific verification'(-ing) BPMS]` and `['(continuous) survive'(-ing) BPMS]`. It allows users to verify that the system is working correctly and to intervene if it drifts.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to long-running tasks, simulations, and complex agentic workflows where progress tracking is essential.
