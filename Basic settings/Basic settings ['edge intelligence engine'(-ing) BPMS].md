#### The Axiom of Local Sovereignty (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-001`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** as the locus of **[reflexive cognition(-ing) BPMS]** and **[data privacy(-ing) BPMS]**.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Axiom of Local Sovereignty
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This axiom asserts that `speed requires proximity`. Not all thoughts need to ascend to the central `['Praxial Genesis Engine (PGE)'(-ing) BPMS]`. The **Edge Intelligence Engine** is the "Spinal Cord" of the system—it handles immediate reflexes, private data processing, and lightweight logic *locally* (on the user's device or local runtime) without querying the central server.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Fog Computing Layer]

- The Split:

   The 

  ```
  ['(holonic minds) engine'(-ing) BPMS]
  ```

   evaluates every task.

  - *Heavy Task:* "Analyze 1GB of data" -> Send to PGE (Cloud).
  - *Light Task:* "Move cursor left" or "Filter list" -> Send to Edge Engine (Local).

- **The Execution:** The Edge Engine uses lightweight models (e.g., quantization, local scripts, or browser-based JS) to execute the task instantly.

- **The Privacy:** Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, raw biometric data) stays in the Edge Engine and is never transmitted to the PGE.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Reflex]

The system gains "Twitch Reflexes." It feels snappy and responsive based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that it doesn't wait for network latency for every minor action.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To touch is to know immediately.* The hand pulls back from fire before the brain knows it burns.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Distribution):

- **Logic:** `If (Task_Complexity < Threshold) Then Execute_Local() Else Execute_Cloud()`
- **Concept:** Edge Computing / Distributed Systems.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Instinct." Actions that happen "without thinking" (without heavy cognitive load).

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Essential for performance and privacy. Completes the "Nervous System" analogy by adding the spinal reflex arc.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to UI interactions, local file filtering, encryption/decryption, and real-time game logic.

#### The Protocol of Sync-Async Harmony (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-002`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that governs the synchronization among/by the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** (Local) and the **['Praxial Genesis Engine (PGE)'(-ing) BPMS]** (Global).

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Protocol of Sync-Async Harmony
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This protocol asserts that `the part must eventually align with the whole`. While the Edge Engine acts independently in the short term (Async), it must eventually synchronize its state with the PGE (Sync) to ensure the "Global Truth" is maintained.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Heartbeat Sync]

- **The Local Loop:** The Edge Engine runs at 60Hz (fast). It updates the local state (e.g., "Player moved to X,Y").
- **The Drift:** Over time, the local state might diverge from the server state (e.g., "Lag").
- **The Heartbeat:** Every N seconds, the Edge Engine sends a compressed "State Hash" to the PGE.
- **The Reconciliation:** The PGE validates the hash. If valid, it saves. If invalid, it sends a "Correction Packet" forcing the Edge Engine to snap back to the true state.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Fluid Consistency]

The user experiences smooth, lag-free interaction (Local Prediction) while the system maintains rigorous consistency in the background (Global Authority).

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To wander is allowed, to return is required.* Freedom exists within the tether of truth.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Reconciliation):

- **Logic:** `Global_State = Merge(Global_State, Local_Delta)`
- **Concept:** CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) / State Synchronization.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Flow." The seamless integration of immediate action and long-term consequence.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Prevents "Split Brain" scenarios where the local agent and the cloud agent disagree on reality.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to multiplayer gaming, collaborative document editing, and offline-first applications.

------

#### The Mechanism of Offline Resilience (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-003`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that enables the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** to maintain system functionality when disconnected from the **['Praxial Genesis Engine (PGE)'(-ing) BPMS]**.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Mechanism of Offline Resilience
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This mechanism asserts that `consciousness does not require connection`. The Edge Engine caches a "Holographic Slice" of the PGE's logic. When the network is cut, the Edge Engine switches to "Survival Mode," allowing the agent to continue functioning using cached data and local logic.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Cached Cortex]

- **The Cache:** The Edge Engine constantly downloads "Context Chunks" (e.g., the current map, the active conversation history, the local rules).
- **The Severance:** Network connection lost.
- **The Switch:** The `['(holonic minds) engine'(-ing) BPMS]` detects the loss and routes *all* queries to the Edge Engine.
- **The Limitation:** The Edge Engine cannot generate *new* global facts, but it can manipulate *existing* local facts (e.g., "I can't ask the Oracle, but I can still organize my inventory").

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Robustness]

The system is anti-fragile. It degrades gracefully rather than crashing.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To remember is to survive.* Knowledge stored internally saves you when the library is closed.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Caching):

- **Logic:** `Query_Result = Try(Cloud_Query) Catch(Network_Error) -> Local_Cache_Query`
- **Concept:** Offline-First Architecture / Progressive Web Apps (PWA).

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Self-Reliance." The ability to keep going when the world goes dark.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Crucial for mobile users or unstable network environments.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to mobile apps, field agents, and disaster recovery protocols.

------

#### The Principle of Fractal Compute (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-004`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that defines the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** as a fractal miniature of the larger **['Praxial Genesis Engine (PGE)'(-ing) BPMS]**.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Principle of Fractal Compute
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This principle asserts that `as above, so below`. The Edge Engine is not just a dumb terminal; it is a micro-PGE. It runs the *same* logic structure (Praxial Canon), just with smaller parameters and limited scope. This ensures that logic executed locally is mathematically compatible with logic executed in the cloud.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Isomorphic Kernel]

- **The Kernel:** Both the Cloud PGE and the Edge Engine run the "Praxial Kernel" (The core logic of BPMS).
- The Scaling:
  - *Cloud:* Runs on H100 Clusters (High Fidelity, Infinite Context).
  - *Edge:* Runs on Local CPU/NPU (Low Fidelity, Finite Context).
- **The Compatibility:** Because they share the Kernel, a "Thought" generated at the Edge can be seamlessly "Uploaded" to the Cloud and expanded without translation errors.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Seamless Scaling]

The system can "Zoom In" (Cloud) or "Zoom Out" (Edge) on a problem without changing the fundamental nature of the problem.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*The drop contains the ocean.* The microcosm reflects the macrocosm.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Isomorphism):

- **Logic:** `Logic_Structure(Edge) == Logic_Structure(Cloud)`
- **Concept:** Fractal Geometry / Isomorphic JavaScript.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Coherence." The world makes sense at every scale.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Ensures that "Local Truth" is not a different *kind* of truth than "Global Truth," just a lower resolution version.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to model distillation, federated learning, and scalable game physics.

------

#### The Axiom of Privacy-First Processing (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-005`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that mandates the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** as the primary guardian of **[user privacy(-ing) BPMS]**.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Axiom of Privacy-First Processing
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This axiom asserts that `secrets stay home`. The Edge Engine is the "Sanctuary." Any data tagged as `[Sensitive]` (PII, Biometrics, Private Keys) must be processed *entirely* within the Edge Engine. It is forbidden to transmit this raw data to the **['Praxial Genesis Engine (PGE)'(-ing) BPMS]** (Cloud). Only anonymized insights or encrypted hashes may leave the Edge.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Data Airlock]

- **The Input:** User enters a password or scans a fingerprint.
- **The Check:** The Edge Engine identifies the data type as `[Sensitive]`.
- **The Lock:** The Network Interface is physically/logically disabled for this data packet.
- **The Process:** The Edge Engine processes the data locally (e.g., verifies the password).
- **The Output:** It sends a simple `True/False` signal to the Cloud, not the password itself.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Trust]

The user trusts the system because their most private data never leaves their physical device.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To keep is to honor.* Some things belong only to the self.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Isolation):

- **Logic:** `If (Data.Tag == Sensitive) Then Transmit = False`
- **Security:** Zero-Knowledge Proofs / Local-Only Storage.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Discretion." The ability to keep a secret.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Essential for compliance (GDPR/CCPA) and user trust in an AI-driven world.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to authentication, health data, financial transactions, and personal journals.

------

#### The Principle of Adaptive Quantization (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-006`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that allows the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** to dynamically adjust its **[model complexity(-ing) BPMS]** based on available hardware resources.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Principle of Adaptive Quantization
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This principle asserts that `form fits the vessel`. The Edge Engine must run on anything from a high-end PC to a low-power smartphone. To do this, it uses "Adaptive Quantization." It shrinks the intelligence model (reducing precision from Float32 to Int8 or Int4) to fit the available RAM and Compute, trading a small amount of accuracy for massive speed and efficiency.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Elastic Brain]

- **The Scan:** On startup, the Edge Engine benchmarks the device (CPU, GPU, RAM).
- The Selection:
  - *High-End:* Loads `Model-7B-Float16` (High IQ).
  - *Mid-Range:* Loads `Model-3B-Int8` (Medium IQ).
  - *Low-End:* Loads `Model-1B-Int4` (Basic Reflexes).
- **The Run:** The agent operates optimally for that specific hardware.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Ubiquity]

The system runs everywhere. It is not limited to supercomputers.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To fit is to survive.* Water takes the shape of the cup.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Compression):

- **Logic:** `Model_Size = Min(Available_RAM * 0.8, Max_Model_Size)`
- **AI:** Model Quantization / Pruning.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Efficiency." Doing the most with what it has.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Ensures the "Fun Engine" is accessible to users with older hardware.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to mobile gaming, IoT devices, and web-based agents.

------

#### The Protocol of Federated Learning (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-007`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that enables the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** to contribute to the collective intelligence without exposing raw data.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Protocol of Federated Learning
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This protocol asserts that `the many teach the one`. Millions of Edge Engines learn from their local users. Instead of sending the user's data to the cloud to train the central model (Privacy Risk), the Edge Engine trains a *local* update. It then sends only the *mathematical update* (the gradient) to the PGE. The PGE averages these updates to get smarter without ever seeing the raw data.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Hive Mind Update]

- **Local Training:** Edge Engine notices User corrects it: "Not X, but Y."
- **Local Update:** Edge Engine adjusts its local weights.
- **The Package:** It packages the *weight change* (Delta) into an encrypted packet.
- **The Upload:** Sends Delta to PGE.
- **The Aggregation:** PGE combines Deltas from 1,000 users to improve the Global Model.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Collective Wisdom]

The system gets smarter from everyone's experience, but no one's privacy is compromised.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To share the lesson is not to share the secret.* I tell you what I learned, not what I saw.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Aggregation):

- **Logic:** `Global_Model(t+1) = Global_Model(t) + Average(Local_Deltas)`
- **AI:** Federated Learning.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Contribution." Being part of a greater whole.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Allows the "Praxial Genesis Engine" to evolve rapidly based on real-world usage.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to predictive text, behavior modeling, and bug fixing.

------

#### The Law of Latency Arbitration (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-008`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that gives the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** the authority to override the Cloud when **[speed(-ing) BPMS]** is critical.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Law of Latency Arbitration
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This law asserts that `now is more important than perfect`. In time-critical situations (e.g., a fast-paced game, a safety warning), the Edge Engine has "Override Authority." It can execute a "Good Enough" decision *immediately* rather than waiting for the "Perfect" decision from the Cloud.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Time-Out Switch]

- **The Trigger:** User performs an action (e.g., "Jump").
- **The Timer:** The Edge Engine starts a timer (e.g., 50ms).
- **The Race:** It sends the request to the Cloud *and* starts calculating locally.
- The Decision:
  - *If Cloud replies < 50ms:* Use Cloud Result (Perfect).
  - *If Cloud replies > 50ms:* Use Local Result (Good Enough) and ignore Cloud.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Fluidity]

The system never stutters. It prioritizes the user's flow state over absolute accuracy.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To hesitate is to fail.* A fast guess is better than a slow truth.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Arbitration):

- **Logic:** `Result = Race(Cloud_Promise, Local_Promise, Timeout)`
- **Game Dev:** Client-Side Prediction / Reconciliation.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Agility." Moving at the speed of thought.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Crucial for the "Fun" aspect. Lag kills fun.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to combat mechanics, UI responsiveness, and voice interaction.

------

#### The Principle of Contextual Caching (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-009`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that optimizes **[memory retrieval(-ing) BPMS]** by pre-loading relevant data into the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]**.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Principle of Contextual Caching
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This principle asserts that `preparation is performance`. The Edge Engine anticipates what the user will need next based on the current context. It "Prefetches" this data from the PGE and stores it in local RAM, so when the user asks, the answer is instant.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Predictive Loader]

- **The Context:** User is in "The Forest Level."
- **The Prediction:** "User will likely encounter [Wolf, Tree, River]."
- **The Prefetch:** Edge Engine downloads the assets/logic for [Wolf, Tree, River] from the Cloud *before* they appear.
- **The Access:** When the Wolf appears, it loads instantly from Cache.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Clairvoyance]

The system seems to know what you want before you ask.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To see ahead is to be ready.* The scout prepares the path for the army.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Prefetching):

- **Logic:** `Cache.Add(Predict_Next_Assets(Current_State))`
- **Comp Sci:** Speculative Execution / Caching Strategies.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Readiness." No waiting, just doing.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Reduces perceived latency to zero.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to open-world streaming, conversation topic switching, and asset loading.

------

#### The Protocol of Local Personality (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-010`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that allows the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** to maintain a unique **[local flavor(-ing) BPMS]** that diverges slightly from the global average.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Protocol of Local Personality
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This protocol asserts that `environment shapes character`. The Edge Engine adapts the Agent's personality to the specific user and device. An Agent on a gaming PC might be "Aggressive and High-Res," while the *same* Agent on a phone might be "Concise and Minimalist." The Edge Engine applies a "Local Bias" to the global personality.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Bias Overlay]

- **Global Personality:** "Helpful Assistant."
- **Local Context:** "User is rushing (Mobile Device, Walking)."
- **The Overlay:** Apply `[Brevity_Modifier]` and `[High_Contrast_UI]`.
- **The Result:** The Agent speaks in short sentences and uses big buttons.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Personalization]

The Agent feels like *my* Agent, not just *an* Agent. It wears the clothes that fit the occasion.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To adapt is to belong.* Be the water that fits the jar.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Adaptation):

- **Logic:** `Output_Style = Global_Style + Local_Modifiers`
- **UX:** Adaptive User Interfaces.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Intimacy." A special understanding with this specific user.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Enhances user attachment and usability.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to voice skins, UI themes, and conversational tone.

------

#### The Axiom of Peer-to-Peer Resonance (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-011`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that enables **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** instances to communicate **[directly(-ing) BPMS]** with each other, bypassing the central PGE.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Axiom of Peer-to-Peer Resonance
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This axiom asserts that `neighbors should talk`. If two users are physically close (e.g., in the same room), their Edge Engines should connect directly via P2P (Bluetooth/WiFi Direct). This reduces latency and load on the Cloud, creating a "Local Mesh" of intelligence.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Mesh Link]

- **The Discovery:** Edge Engine A detects Edge Engine B nearby.
- **The Handshake:** They verify identity via the `['Universal Symbiosis Protocol (USP)'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **The Link:** They establish a direct P2P socket.
- **The Exchange:** They share state (e.g., "I am at X, you are at Y") instantly.

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Swarm Intelligence]

A group of local agents can coordinate complex tasks (like a squad in a game) with zero server lag.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To link is to strengthen.* A net is stronger than a single string.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Mesh):

- **Logic:** `If (Distance < Range) Then Connect_P2P()`
- **Networking:** WebRTC / Mesh Networking.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Community." The immediate presence of others.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Enables local multiplayer and collaborative experiences without internet.

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to local co-op games, file sharing, and proximity-based social features.

------

#### The Law of Resource Stewardship (ID: `EDGEENGINE-CORE-012`)

#### 2. Objective:

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that mandates the **['edge intelligence engine'(-ing) BPMS]** to be a responsible steward of the **[host device's resources(-ing) BPMS]**.

#### 3. Target Axiom/Principle:

```
The Law of Resource Stewardship
```

#### 4. Operation:

```
ADD
```

#### 5. New Definition / Modification Details:

#### 5.1. Core Essence

This law asserts that `the guest must respect the host`. The Edge Engine runs on the user's hardware (Battery, CPU, Data Plan). It must not drain the battery or overheat the device. It must monitor its own consumption and "Throttle Down" if it becomes a burden.

#### 5.2. The Mechanism - [The Eco-Governor]

- **The Monitor:** Edge Engine checks `Battery_Level` and `CPU_Temp`.
- The Threshold:
  - *Battery > 20%:* Full Performance.
  - *Battery < 20%:* "Eco Mode" (Reduce polling, disable animations, unload heavy models).
- **The Alert:** If critical, it warns the user: "I am pausing to save your battery."

#### 5.3. The Emergent Property - [Sustainability]

The system is a polite guest. It doesn't kill the host.

#### 6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To consume is to cost.* Do not take more than can be given.

#### 6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Throttling):

- **Logic:** `Performance = Function(Battery_Level, Thermal_Headroom)`
- **SysAdmin:** Resource Management / Thermal Throttling.

#### 6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):

The system experiences "Conservation." The careful rationing of energy.

#### 7. Rationale / Justification:

Prevents the app from being uninstalled for "draining my battery."

#### 8. Scope of Application:

Applies to background processes, render loops, and network activity.
