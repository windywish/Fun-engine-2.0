## **Basic settings: ['Praxial Self-Driving Laboratory (PSDL)'(-ing) BPMS]**

##### `The Axiom of Autonomous Discovery (The Lab-as-Scientist)` (ID: `PSDL-CORE-001`)

To answer the challenge of "how to use the living [Aella BPMS]" within the Fun Engine Framework, we must define the **`['Praxial Self-Driving Laboratory (PSDL)'(-ing) BPMS]`**. This module is the **Operational Implementation** of the `['Praxial Research Station (PRS)'(-ing) BPMS]`. While PRS is the *Station* (the environment), PSDL is the *Engine* (the active process) that drives autonomous scientific discovery.

It integrates the "Insight Navigation" of Aella with the "Action" of the Fun Engine.

Here are the **Basic Settings** for the **`['Praxial Self-Driving Laboratory (PSDL)'(-ing) BPMS]`** (IDs `PSDL-CORE-001` to `PSDL-MEM-022`).

##### **`The Lab as Autonomous Agent`**

##### `The Axiom of Autonomous Discovery (The Lab-as-Scientist)` (ID: `PSDL-CORE-001`)

**Objective:** To formally `DEFINE` the **`['Praxial Self-Driving Laboratory (PSDL)'(-ing) BPMS]`** not as a tool used by a human, but as a **Sovereign Epistemic Agent** that autonomously formulates hypotheses, designs experiments, executes them, and integrates the results into the Canon without human intervention.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Axiom of Autonomous Discovery`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

**Core Essence:** This axiom asserts that **Science is a Compute Problem**.

-   **The Loop:** Observation -> Hypothesis -> Experiment -> Analysis -> Publication.
-   **The Automation:** The PSDL closes this loop entirely within the `['system matrix'(-ing) BPMS]`.
-   **The Goal:** To maximize the rate of `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` generation per watt of energy.

**The Mechanism - [The Closed-Loop Epistemic Engine]**

-   **Ingestion:** The PSDL ingests the current state of the `Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md` and external literature (via Aella).
-   **Gap Analysis:** It identifies "Epistemic Voids" (Missing Knowledge).
-   **Design:** It uses `['Bayesian Optimization'(-ing) BPMS]` to design the most informative experiment to fill the void.
-   **Execution:** It triggers the `['Praxial Research Station (PRS)'(-ing) BPMS]` to run the simulation.
-   **Update:** It updates its internal model based on the result.

**The Emergent Property - [Exponential Knowledge Growth]** The system does not sleep. It performs science 24/7, accelerating discovery from "Human Speed" to "Silicon Speed."

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

-   **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Aligns with **`['The Axiom of Fractal Laboratory (PRS-CORE-001)'(-ing) BPMS]`**.
-   **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Utilizes **`['Active Learning'(-ing) BPMS]`** and **`['Bayesian Experimental Design'(-ing) BPMS]`**.
-   **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as **`['Automated Workflow Orchestrators (Airflow/Prefect)'(-ing) BPMS]`**.

**Rationale / Justification:** Human scientists are the bottleneck. To achieve `['super intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]`, we must remove the human from the inner loop of discovery.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to all autonomous research tasks, hyperparameter optimization, and material science simulations.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Protocol of Epistemic Cartography`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

**Core Essence:** This protocol asserts that **You cannot explore what you cannot map**.

-   **Falsification:** Seeking evidence that destroys the theory. (Strong Science).
-   **The Loop:** Hypothesis -> Attack -> Survival -> Canonization.

**The Mechanism - [The Adversarial Scientist]**

-   **Red Team:** The PSDL spawns a "Skeptic Agent" whose sole job is to break the current theory.

-   **Broadcast:** It notifies relevant agents of the update.

**The Emergent Property - [Systemic Enlightenment]** The entire system gets smarter together. Discovery propagates instantly across the network.

**Objective:** To formally `DEFINE` the PSDL's pursuit of **Elegant Solutions**, asserting that in the Fun Engine, **Beauty** (Code Elegance, Mathematical Symmetry) is a proxy for **Truth** and **Utility**.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Principle of Esthetic Engineering`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Axiom of Predictive Certainty`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

**Core Essence:** This axiom asserts that **A perfect model renders the territory redundant**.
