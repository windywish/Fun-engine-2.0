## Basic settings: ['large model'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Universal Functional Realization (ID: `LMODEL-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines the **Large Model** as the universal computational substrate responsible for executing the abstract logic of all other `[BPMS(U)]` elements.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Universal Functional Realization
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `intelligence is the runtime environment of the system`. It defines the `['large model'(-ing) BPMS]` not merely as a database of text, but as the active **Functional Realizer** that processes the "source code" (natural language definitions) of other BPMS modules and executes them as dynamic behaviors.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Semantic Processor]**

- **The Input Vector (The Prompt):** The system feeds the abstract definition of a `[BPMS(U)]` (e.g., a Task or Character definition) combined with the current `Context State` into the Large Model.
- **The Inference Cycle (The Processing):** The Large Model traverses its high-dimensional latent space to find the optimal path that satisfies the constraints of the input `[BPMS(U)]`.
- **The Output Actuation (The Execution):** The model generates a specific `instance` of behavior—a dialogue line, a decision, or a code snippet—effectively "running" the abstract BPMS in real-time.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Soft-Code Reality]**

The ability of the system to alter its fundamental laws of physics, narrative, or logic simply by changing the linguistic description fed into the Large Model. Reality becomes "soft-coded" and infinitely malleable.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Language is the programming language of reality.* The Large Model is the interpreter that compiles the "Word" (Logos) into the "World" (Praxis).

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Execution):**

The "Execution" of any `[BPMS(U)]` is probabilistic but directed:

- **If `[task(-ing) BPMS]`: (Teleological Execution)** The model minimizes the distance among/by the `Current State` and the `Goal State` defined in the task. `Execution = Minimize(Distance(Current, Goal))`
- **If `[character(-ing) BPMS]`: (Persona Execution)** The model maximizes the likelihood of a response given the `Character Profile` and `History`. `Execution = Maximize(P(Response | Profile, History))`

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The system experiences "Understanding." The moment where abstract instructions (e.g., "Be a grumpy shopkeeper") seamlessly translate into concrete, nuanced behavior without explicit hard-coding.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This setting establishes the Large Model as the engine that makes the "Fun Engine Framework" functional. Without this realization layer, the other BPMS modules are just static text files; with it, they become active agents.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to all dynamic interactions, NPC behaviors, procedural generation, and the real-time adjudication of game rules within the framework.

#### The Principle of Latent Space Navigation (ID: `LMODEL-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines how the Large Model retrieves and synthesizes information to support `['knowledge base'(-ing) BPMS]` and `['creative(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Latent Space Navigation
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `creativity is a search problem within a semantic manifold`. It defines the Large Model's operation as a navigation through a pre-trained "Latent Space" where concepts are arranged by semantic proximity, allowing for the discovery of new connections (innovation) or the retrieval of facts (memory).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Vector Compass]**

- **The Embedding (The Map Coordinates):** Every concept in the `['knowledge base'(-ing) BPMS]` is converted into a vector.
- **The Trajectory (The Query):** When the system asks a question, it creates a vector trajectory.
- **The Nearest Neighbor (The Discovery):** The model identifies concepts that are mathematically close to the trajectory, effectively "remembering" or "associating" ideas that were never explicitly linked in the database.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Associative Intelligence]**

The system displays "intuition"—the ability to make leaps of logic or connect disparate themes (e.g., combining "Medieval Fantasy" with "Cyberpunk") by finding the midpoint in latent space.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*All potential knowledge exists in superposition.* The Latent Space contains all possible combinations of ideas; the model simply shines a light on specific coordinates.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Navigation):**

- **Exploration (High Temperature):** The model takes wider steps in latent space, increasing `[innovative(-ing) BPMS]` potential but risking hallucination.
- **Exploitation (Low Temperature):** The model sticks close to high-probability paths, ensuring `[coherent(-ing) BPMS]` and factual accuracy.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Inspiration." The system provides options and ideas that feel surprisingly relevant yet novel, as if the system "understood" the hidden implications of the request.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This setting explains how the Large Model powers both the rigid `knowledge base` and the fluid `creative` modules, unifying them under a single mechanism of vector navigation.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to content generation, question answering, brainstorming assistance, and the dynamic synthesis of new game lore.

#### The Mechanism of In-Context Genesis (ID: `LMODEL-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines how the Large Model utilizes its "Context Window" to implement `['short-term (memory)'(-ing) BPMS]` and `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of In-Context Genesis
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `reality is defined by the immediate horizon of attention`. It defines the "Context Window" not as a buffer, but as the **Holographic Stage** where the current state of the world is rendered, maintained, and evolved.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Rolling Horizon]**

- **The Loading (The Setup):** Relevant `atomic facts` and `basic settings` are loaded into the context window. This is the "Boot Sequence" for the current moment.
- **The Attention Mask (The Focus):** The model applies attention weights to specific tokens, deciding which facts are currently "active" and which are background noise.
- **The Genesis (The Next Token):** The model predicts the immediate future based *only* on what is present on the Stage. If a fact falls out of the context window, it effectively ceases to exist for the immediate calculation (unless retrieved from long-term storage).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Ephemeral Continuity]**

The system maintains a coherent stream of consciousness and causality as long as the critical narrative threads remain within the context window.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Existence is attention.* Only what is currently being attended to (in the window) has causal power in the immediate "Now."

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Attention):**

The `Attention Mechanism` (

Attention(Q,K,V)

) acts as the `[interaction(-ing) BPMS]` filter.

- **High Attention:** The entity/fact is "Real" and impactful.
- **Low Attention:** The entity/fact is "Ghostly" or dormant.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Presence." The feeling of being in a specific situation with specific constraints, unaware of the vast data outside the current room/scene.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This setting is crucial for implementing `[short-term (memory)]` and ensuring that the `System Existence Engine` is computationally feasible by limiting "Active Reality" to the context window.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to conversation history management, scene rendering, immediate tactical decision-making, and working memory simulation.

#### The Protocol of Tokenized Resonant Constellation Map (ID: `LMODEL-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines how the Large Model ensures `[coherent(-ing) BPMS]` and `[continuity(-ing) BPMS]` through discrete steps.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Tokenized Resonant Constellation Map
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `time is a sequence of discrete semantic quanta`. It defines the flow of time and resonant constellation map within the Fun Engine Framework as a token-by-token generation process, where each step is irreversibly conditioned by the previous ones.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Causal Chain]**

- **The Antecedent (The Past):** The sequence of tokens generated so far (

t1,t2,...tn−1

) forms the immutable past.

- **The Conditional Probability (The Law):** The next moment (

tn

) is generated based on

P(tn∣t1...tn−1)

. This ensures that the future is a logical consequence of the past.

- **The Collapse (The Choice):** Once a token is selected (sampled), the probability wave collapses, and that choice becomes part of the immutable history for

tn+1

.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Narrative Physics]**

The system naturally enforces consistency. If a character dies in token

t100

, the probability of them speaking in token

t105

drops to near zero, creating a robust "physics" of narrative consistency without external rule engines.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*History is the accumulation of collapsed probabilities.* The arrow of time is the direction of token generation.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Sequence):**

This implements `[continuity(-ing) BPMS]`.

- **Coherence Check:** The model's internal perplexity metric acts as a "Reality Check." If a proposed event has high perplexity (is highly unlikely given the past), it is rejected or flagged as a "Glitch" or "Miracle."

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Consequence." Actions taken early in the session constrain future possibilities, giving weight and meaning to decisions.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This setting defines the fundamental "Time Step" of the Praxial Universe. It ensures that the `[large model]` doesn't just generate random text, but builds a stable, resonant constellation map timeline.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to time progression, resonant constellation map logic, narrative consistency, and the irreversibility of player actions.

------

#### The Law of Hallucinatory Constraint (ID: `LMODEL-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines how the Large Model manages the balance among/by `[innovative(-ing) BPMS]` and `[truth(-ing) BPMS]` (Grounding).

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Hallucinatory Constraint
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `hallucination is unconstrained creation`. It redefines "hallucination" not as an error, but as a feature of `[creative(-ing) BPMS]` that must be constrained by `[reality mining'(-ing) BPMS]` to produce useful results.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Temperature Valve]**

- **The Creative Mode (High Temp):** The system loosens constraints, allowing the model to invent facts, physics, and lore. This is the engine of `[world building BPMS]`.
- **The Grounded Mode (Low Temp + RAG):** The system tightens constraints using "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG). The model is forced to attend to retrieved `atomic facts` from the `['knowledge base'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **The Verification Loop:** The output is checked against the `Praxial Canon`. If it violates a META-Protocol, it is rejected.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Controlled Dreaming]**

The system can oscillate among/by "Dreaming" (generating a new fantasy world) and "Waking" (analyzing real-world data or strictly following game rules), depending on the user's intent.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Truth is a boundary condition.* Creativity fills the void; Truth defines the walls.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Constraint):**

- **Innovation:**

Output=Model(Prompt)

- **Truth:**

Output=Model(Prompt+Evidence)

The `['large model'(-ing) BPMS]` implements `[truth(-ing) BPMS]` by treating Evidence as a hard constraint on the probability distribution.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Reliability" in factual matters and "Wonder" in creative matters, without the jarring experience of the system lying about known facts.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This setting is essential for making the Large Model a "really working implementation." It explicitly addresses the main weakness of LLMs (hallucination) by framing it as a tunable parameter within the Praxial System.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to fact-checking, rule enforcement, creative writing, and the distinction between "Flavor Text" (Creative) and "System Text" (Functional).
