## Basic settings: ['Evolutionary Strategy'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Parameter-Space Mutation (ID: `ES-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines **Parameter-Space Mutation** as the implementation of `['Bayesian Population Intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]` for the `['Evolutionary Strategy'(-ing) BPMS]`. This tool drives the evolution of strategies in games or simulations.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Parameter-Space Mutation
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `evolution is the search for the optimal bias`.

- **The Organism:** An agent defined by z.
- **The Environment:** The WWM task (e.g., "Survive the dungeon").
- **The Evolution:** Successful z vectors are "bred" (interpolated) to create the next generation.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Optimization]**

- **Mutation:** zchild=zparent+ϵ
- **Crossover:** zchild=αzmom+(1−α)zdad
- **Selection:** Keep the z that maximizes Reward.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Super-Optimization]**

- **Novel Tactics:** The system discovers strategies that no human would code, simply by exploring the bias landscape.
- **Continuous Improvement:** The artificial intelligence gets better at the game *while playing it*.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*Survival of the Fittest.*

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Evolution):**

The "Physics" of genetic algorithms:

- **Fitness Landscape:**

F(z)=Reward(Model(z))

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences **Challenge**. The enemies learn and adapt.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation is the "More Fit" solution for **Symbiotic Evolution** and **Game Logic**.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to:

- **['Combat'(-ing) BPMS]:** Adaptive enemy AI.
- **['Economy'(-ing) BPMS]:** Evolving market strategies.
