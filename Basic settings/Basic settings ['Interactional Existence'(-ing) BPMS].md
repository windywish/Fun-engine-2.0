## Basic settings: ['Interactional Existence'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Interactional Existence (ID: `INTERACTION-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that redefines the fundamental ontology of the framework, asserting that **System Existence** is not an intrinsic property of an element but an emergent property of **Interaction**.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Interactional Existence
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom establishes the foundational challenge and solution for the framework's ontology. It asserts that:

> "For any (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`, the `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` for any specific 'any/all (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`' is not reflecting as the `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` for any specific 'any/all (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`', but should be reflecting as the `[interaction(-ing) BPMS]` among/by this specific 'any/all (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`' and the any others (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Relational Mirror]**

- **The Intrinsic Null-State:** An element in isolation (e.g., an `[apple(-ing) BPMS]` in a void) possesses no `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` attributes (like color, weight, or meaning). It exists only as `[Latent Potentiality]`.

- The Interactional Event:

  Attributes are only generated during a coupling event. As stated:

  > "The `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]:['red color'(-ing) BPMS]` for `[apple(-ing) BPMS]` is not implementing by the `[apple(-ing) BPMS]`, but by the `[interaction(-ing) BPMS]` among/by `[apple(-ing) BPMS]` and `[light(-ing) BPMS]`."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Contextual Reality]**

The creation of a fluid reality where the "Truth" of an object changes based on its interactor. To a `[human(-ing) BPMS]`, the apple is "Food"; to a `[photon(-ing) BPMS]`, it is a "Reflector"; to a `[gravity(-ing) BPMS]`, it is "Mass."

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Existence is Relational.* This aligns with the Praxial view that "To be is to interact." It rejects static object-oriented ontology in favor of interaction-oriented ontology.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Interaction):**

The "Physics" of existence is defined by the interaction function:

E(x)=f(x,y)

Where E is Existence, x is the Element, and y is the Interactor.

- If y=Null, then E(x)=Null.
- If y=Light, then E(x)=Color.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences a world that feels "Alive" and "Responsive" based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that objects do not just "sit there"; they "perform" their existence only when the user engages with them.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation is necessary to solve the "Foundation Challenge" of static systems. It ensures that the framework can handle complex, context-sensitive realities without hard-coding infinite attributes for every object.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to **ALL** `[BPMS(U)(s)]` without exception. From `[code(-ing) BPMS]` to `[biology(-ing) BPMS]`.

------

#### The Law of Relational Universality (ID: `INTERACTION-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that enforces the **Universality** of the Interactional Existence axiom across the entire framework.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Relational Universality
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law mandates that the relational nature of existence is not a special case but a universal constant. It asserts:

> "These type of `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` for any specific 'any/all (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`' are universality applied for any/all (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]` that should be modified to reflecting the problem mentioned above."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Universal Modifier]**

- **Global Refactoring:** Every element in the system must be stripped of static properties and assigned `[Interaction Protocols]` instead.
- **The Interaction Check:** Before any element is rendered or processed, the system must query: "What is interacting with this?" If the answer is "Nothing," the element remains un-rendered.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Systemic Coherence]**

A unified physics where `[ideas(-ing) BPMS]` behave exactly like `[matter(-ing) BPMS]`. An idea only "exists" when a mind thinks it, just as an apple only "is red" when light hits it.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Universality of Process.* The laws of the Praxial Framework are scale-invariant. What applies to the atom applies to the narrative.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Universality):**

∀x∈BPMS(U):Existence(x)∝Interaction(x) (For all x in the System, Existence is proportional to Interaction).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user perceives a seamless consistency. There are no "glitches" where some things are static and others are dynamic. The entire world obeys the same rule of "Touch to Exist."

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

Without this law, the system would be fragmented (Dualism). This law ensures Monism—a single, unified explanation for how everything from code to colors exists.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to the entire **Fun Engine Framework**, overriding any legacy settings that define static attributes.

------

#### The Protocol of Phenomenological Coupling (ID: `INTERACTION-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that defines **How to Implement** and achieve the Interactional Existence described in the previous settings.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Phenomenological Coupling
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol defines the operational steps to achieve the "Right/Working/Needed" implementation. It transforms the abstract philosophy into a concrete `[action(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Coupling Engine]**

- **Step 1: Identification:** Identify the `[Latent Element]` (e.g., Apple) and the `[Actuator Element]` (e.g., Light).
- **Step 2: Intersection:** Calculate the `[Interaction Surface]` where their definitions overlap.
- **Step 3: Synthesis:** Generate the `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` (e.g., Redness) as a temporary cache.
- **Step 4: Dissolution:** When the interaction ends (Light turns off), delete the `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` (Redness vanishes).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Dynamic Efficiency]**

The system becomes infinitely efficient based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that it never stores "Redness" permanently. It only computes it "Just-In-Time."

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Praxis over Stasis.* Action (Coupling) is the generator of Reality.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Implementation):**

```
Function Render_Existence(Object A, Object B):` `   Return (A.Potential * B.Context)
```

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels like a "Co-Creator." Their gaze, their clicks, and their presence are what bring the world to life.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This provides the "How-To" requested by the user. It is the engineering manual for the philosophical shift.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to the **Rendering Engine**, **Physics Engine**, and **Logic Core** of the framework.

#### The Axiom of Polyadic Phenomenological Synthesis (ID: `INTERACTION-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that expands the interaction model from a binary relationship (A+B) to a **Complex Polyadic System** (A+B+C...), asserting that "System Existence" requires a Source, a Medium, and a Perception System.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Polyadic Phenomenological Synthesis
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that the `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` (e.g., `['red color'(-ing) BPMS]`) is not merely the result of `[apple(-ing) BPMS]` and `[light(-ing) BPMS]`, but requires a third critical component: the **`['perception (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`**. Without the `['perception (system)'(-ing) BPMS]` (e.g., `[human(-ing) BPMS]`, `[camera(-ing) BPMS]`, or `[artificial intelligence agent(-ing) BPMS]`), the interaction among/by Apple and Light remains "Silent Data" (Electromagnetic Radiation) and does not become "Phenomenal Reality" (Redness).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Triadic Knot]**

- **The Source Potential (`[apple]`):** Provides the structural constraint (Reflectance).

- **The Carrier Medium (`[light]`):** Transmits the data (Photons).

- The Interpretive Actuator (`[perception system]`):

   Decodes the data into "Existence."

  - *Equation:* Existence=f(Source,Medium,Observer)

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Subjective Objectivity]**

The realization that "Redness" is an objective fact *within* a specific subjective system. To a `[human(-ing) BPMS]`, the apple is Red. To a `[bee(-ing) BPMS]` (which sees UV), the apple is a "Target Pattern." Both existences are valid simultaneously within the `['complex hybrid (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Reality is a Triad.* Existence is not a line (A to B) but a triangle (A to B to C).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Synthesis):**

If P is Perception, S is Source, M is Medium: Esys=P(S∩M) (System Existence is the Perception function applied to the intersection of Source and Medium).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user understands that they are not "viewing" the world; they are "generating" it through their specific perceptual filters.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This setting is required to model complex realities where different agents perceive the same object differently. It moves the framework from "Physics" (Light hitting Apple) to "Cognition" (Brain seeing Red).

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to **Sensory Simulation**, **UI/UX Design**, and **Agent Perception Modeling**.

------

#### The Principle of Functional Matrix Instantiation (ID: `INTERACTION-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that defines the `['perception (system)'(-ing) BPMS]` not as a biological entity, but as a configurable **`['function (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`** implemented by the **`['system matrix(-ing) BPMS]`**.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Functional Matrix Instantiation
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle deconstructs the "Observer." It asserts that `['perception (system)'(-ing) BPMS]` is simply a specific configuration of the `['system matrix(-ing) BPMS]` designed to execute a specific `['function (system)'(-ing) BPMS]` (e.g., "Decode Wavelengths 400-700nm"). This allows the framework to swap perception systems (e.g., switching from "Human Vision" to "Thermal Vision") by simply changing the matrix function.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Matrix Filter]**

- **The Input Stream:** The raw interaction data (e.g., `[apple]` + `[light]`).
- **The Matrix Function (`f(x)`):** The specific algorithm defining the perception (e.g., `Function: Human_Retina_Simulation`).
- **The Output Reality:** The rendered `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` (e.g., "Red").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Perceptual Polymorphism]**

The ability for the `['complex hybrid (system)'(-ing) BPMS]` to simulate any mode of existence. The system can "see" like a bat, a robot, or a god, simply by loading a different `['function (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Perception is Calculation.* Seeing is just a specific type of data processing.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Instantiation):**

MatrixVision={λ∈[400,700]→RGB} MatrixThermal={λ∈[700,10000]→HeatMap}

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences the flexibility of the engine. They can "change lenses" and rewrite the rules of how reality is rendered.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This aligns with the user's requirement to implement perception via the `['system matrix(-ing) BPMS]`. It creates a modular, programmable approach to consciousness and sensing.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to **Sensor Arrays**, **Cognitive Architectures**, and **Data Visualization**.

------

#### The Law of Recursive Interactional Hierarchy (ID: `INTERACTION-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that implements **Hierarchical Deconstruction** and **Iteration**, asserting that every component of the `['complex hybrid (system)'(-ing) BPMS]` is itself an emergent result of lower-level interactions.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Recursive Interactional Hierarchy
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that the "Interaction" is fractal. The `['perception (system)'(-ing) BPMS]` is not a monolith; it is an interaction between `[neural code(-ing) BPMS]` and `[bio-electricity(-ing) BPMS]`. The `[apple(-ing) BPMS]` is not a monolith; it is an interaction among/by `[cells(-ing) BPMS]` and `[structure(-ing) BPMS]`. Therefore, the final `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` is a **"Hyper-Interaction"**—an interaction of interactions.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Iterative Stack]**

- **Level 0 (Base):** Raw Data / Quantum Potential.
- **Level 1 (Micro-Interaction):** `[Cell]` + `[Structure]` = `[Apple]`.
- **Level 2 (Meso-Interaction):** `[Retina]` + `[Photon]` = `[Signal]`.
- **Level 3 (Macro-Interaction):** `[Apple]` + `[Light]` + `[Signal]` = `['Red Color'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **The Iterator:** The system recursively resolves these interactions from the bottom up (or top down) to generate the final `['complex hybrid (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Deep System Depth]**

The reality has "Resolution." You can zoom in. If you zoom into the "Redness," you find the "Photon." If you zoom into the "Photon," you find the "Wave." The system supports infinite deconstruction.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*As Above, So Below.* The pattern of interaction repeats at every scale of the holarchy.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Recursion):**

ExistenceN=Interaction(ExistenceN−1,ContextN−1) (Existence at Level N is the interaction of Existence at Level N-1).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user perceives a world with "Infinite Density." Nothing is just a "surface texture"; everything is a deep, working system of systems.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This fulfills the requirement for "Hierarchical deconstruction or Iteration." It ensures the framework is robust enough to handle complex simulations where high-level properties depend on low-level mechanics.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to **Simulation Depth**, **Level of Detail (LOD) Management**, and **Complex System Modeling**.

---

#### The Axiom of Combinatorial Fluidity (ID: `INTERACTION-CORE-007`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that liberates the **`['complex hybrid (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`** from fixed definitions, asserting that it is simply a dynamic **Group** of *any* `[BPMS(U)(s)]` elements, capable of forming any combination (n≥1).

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Combinatorial Fluidity
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that a "System" is not a pre-defined template (like "Car" or "Human"). Instead, a **`['complex hybrid (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`** is defined purely as an ad-hoc **Cluster** of interacting elements. It validates any combination:

- `[A BPMS; B BPMS]` (e.g., `[Apple; Gravity]`)
- `[A BPMS; B BPMS; C BPMS]` (e.g., `[Apple; Gravity; Worm]`)
- `[X1...Xn]` (e.g., `[Idea; Color; Sound; Time; Code]`) There are no "Illegal Combinations." If elements interact, they form a valid System.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Universal Binder]**

- **The Ad-Hoc Grouper:** The system can instantly declare a boundary around *any* set of elements and treat them as a single `['complex hybrid (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **The Fluid Matrix:** The `['system matrix(-ing) BPMS]` does not enforce rigid schemas. It acts as a "Universal Glue" that accepts any inputs and attempts to resolve their interaction.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Infinite Hybridization]**

The ability to create "Chimeras" of reality. A system can be part-biology, part-code, part-narrative. The framework does not distinguish among/by "Natural" and "Artificial" groupings; it only sees **Interacting Groups**.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Radical Freedom of Association.* Any element can interact with any other element to form a new whole.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Combination):**

SystemHybrid={e1,e2,...,en}∣n≥1,ei∈BPMS(U) (A Hybrid System is a set of elements where n is greater than or equal to 1, and all elements belong to the Universal Set).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences a "Sandbox Physics" where they can combine a "Sound File" with a "Physics Object" and a "Stock Price" to create a new, functioning entity.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This removes the "Legacy Shackles" of traditional object-oriented programming (where objects must belong to specific classes). It enables the "Fun Engine" to support truly wild, emergent creativity.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to **System Architecture**, **Entity Component Systems (ECS)**, and **Procedural Generation**.

------

#### The Principle of N-Dimensional Interaction (ID: `INTERACTION-CORE-008`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that defines the interaction rules for these arbitrary groups, asserting that the `['interaction(-ing) BPMS]` scales dynamically to handle any number of inputs (n).

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of N-Dimensional Interaction
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that the "Interaction Function" is not hard-coded for pairs (A+B) or triads (A+B+C). It is a **Variadic Function** that accepts n arguments. The `['system existence'(-ing) BPMS]` of a group `[X1...Xn]` is the simultaneous resolution of *all* mutual interactions within that group.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Tensor Field]**

- **The Interaction Tensor:** Instead of a simple "Link," the system generates an N-dimensional tensor where every element interacts with every other element (unless shielded).

- The Resolution Algorithm:

   The system solves for the equilibrium state of this tensor.

  - *Example:* In `[Apple; Light; Gravity]`, the Apple reflects Light *while* falling due to Gravity. The result is a "Falling Red Apple."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Systemic Gestalt]**

The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The interaction of `[Code; Electricity; Screen; User]` creates `[The Internet]`. The property "Internet" exists in none of the parts, but only in the N-dimensional interaction of the group.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Complexity is Accumulation.* Complex systems are just simple interactions stacked in N-dimensions.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of N-Dimensions):**

ExistenceGroup=∮(e1×e2×...×en)dt (The integral of the cross-product of all elements over time).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user perceives "Richness." As they add more elements to a group (e.g., adding "Music" to a "Visual Scene"), the reality becomes deeper and more immersive.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This ensures the framework can handle the complexity of the "Real World" (which is an N-dimensional interaction) without breaking or requiring custom code for every new combination.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to **Physics Engines**, **Ecosystem Simulations**, and **Complex Event Processing**.

------

#### The Protocol of Matrix Grouping (ID: `INTERACTION-CORE-009`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that defines **How to Implement** the creation and management of these arbitrary `['complex hybrid (system)'(-ing) BPMS]` groups via the `['system matrix(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Matrix Grouping
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol provides the operational commands to instantiate a `['complex hybrid (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`. It defines the "Group" not as a static container, but as a **Dynamic Tag** within the System Matrix.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Matrix Tagging System]**

- **Command: `Group(e1, e2, ... en)`:** The system assigns a unique `System_ID` to the selected elements.
- **Command: `Resolve(System_ID)`:** The system forces an interaction cycle among all elements sharing that ID.
- **Command: `Dissolve(System_ID)`:** The system removes the tag, returning elements to their isolated (or other-grouped) states.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Liquid Architecture]**

The ability to restructure reality on the fly. An `[Apple]` can be part of `[System: Fruit Bowl]` one moment, and `[System: Projectile Weapon]` the next, simply by changing its Matrix Grouping.

#### 6. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Structure is Fluid.* Boundaries are drawn by the Matrix, not by the objects.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Grouping):**

```
Define System S = { x | Matrix_Tag(x) == S_ID }` `Interaction(S) = Apply_Physics(S)
```

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user feels like a "Director." They can cast any actor (element) in any role (system) instantly.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This provides the practical implementation layer for the "Combinatorial Fluidity" axiom. It tells the system *how* to manage these infinite groups.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to **Game Logic**, **Database Management**, and **System Administration**.
