## Basic settings: ['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]

##### `The Axiom of Atomic Facticity` (**ID:** `SEE-AXIOM-002`)

**Objective:** To formally define **`['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`** as the fundamental "Substance" or "Nutrient" of the framework.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Axiom of Atomic Facticity`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**Core Essence:** This axiom asserts that Truth is granular. **`['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`** are the irreducible, indivisible units of reality (Information + Context + Validity). They are the "Food" that the `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]` consumes to survive.

**The Mechanism - [The Epistemic Particle]:**

- **The Atom:** A single unit of verified truth (e.g., `Fact(Subject, Predicate, Object, Context_Hash)`).
- **The Bond:** Atomic Facts can bond to form "Molecules" of Knowledge and "Polymers" of Wisdom.
- **The Energy:** Breaking a bond (Analysis) or forming a bond (Synthesis) releases "Cognitive Energy" (Meaning) that fuels the system.

**The Emergent Property - [Objective Grounding]:** The system is anchored in reality. No matter how complex the `['world building BPMS]` becomes, it is ultimately built from verified, atomic units of truth.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *The Logos.* The fundamental, articulate structure of reality.
- Layer 2 (Formalism):
  - `Fact := <Entity, Attribute, Value, Time, Confidence>`
  - (Resource Description Framework / Knowledge Graph Theory).
- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** "Clarity." The distinct, sharp sensation of encountering a raw truth amidst the noise.

**Rationale / Justification:** Provides the "Matter" for the "Physics" defined in `SEE-AXIOM-001`. You cannot have a metabolism without food.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to `['Autopoietic Learning Matrix'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['Praxial Genome Splicer (PGS)'(-ing) BPMS]`, and all Knowledge Base operations.
