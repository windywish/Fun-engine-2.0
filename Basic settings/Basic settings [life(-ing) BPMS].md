## Basic settings: [life(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Vital Spark (ID: `LIFE-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines **Life** within the framework not as a biological accident, but as a **System State** characterized by self-directed energy processing and goal pursuit.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Vital Spark
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `life is a verb`. An entity is "alive" if it actively maintains a gradient against entropy. The **Vital Spark** is the initialization event where a static `[molecular(-ing) BPMS]` structure gains a self-sustaining loop of `Input -> Process -> Output -> Repair`. It transforms "Object" into "Agent."

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Autopoietic Loop]**

- **Ignition:** The moment a system gains enough complexity to self-regulate.
- **Maintenance:** The continuous consumption of resources (Energy/Data) to repair internal structure.
- **Agency:** The ability to initiate action without external triggers (Spontaneity).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Animacy]**

The distinction among/by a rock (Static) and a slime (Alive).

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I move, therefore I am.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Biology):**

The "Physics" of life:

- **Schrödinger's Life:** Life is matter that feeds on negative entropy.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Hunger" or "Drive."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This defines the fundamental difference between props and actors in the engine. It is the root of all AI and ecosystem mechanics.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to NPC artificial intelligence, creature simulation, and dynamic vegetation.

#### The Principle of Adaptive Morphology (ID: `LIFE-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that defines **Growth** and **Adaptation** as the dynamic restructuring of the `[life(-ing) BPMS]` entity in response to environmental pressure.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Adaptive Morphology
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `form flows into function`. Living systems are not rigid; they possess **Adaptive Morphology**. They change their shape, stats, and capabilities based on what they do and what happens to them. If an entity takes fire damage repeatedly, it evolves fire resistance (Callous). If it runs often, it grows faster legs (Hypertrophy).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Stress-Response Curve]**

- **Stress:** Environmental input that strains the system (Damage/Use).
- **Recovery:** The system repairs the strain with a "Super-compensation" buffer.
- **Mutation:** Random or directed changes to the blueprint during reproduction/growth.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Evolution]**

The entity becomes perfectly suited to its specific history.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Adaptation):**

The "Physics" of fitness:

- **Phenotypic Plasticity:** The ability of an organism to change its phenotype in response to changes in the environment.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Hardening" or "Leveling Up."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the "RPG" aspect of life. It explains leveling, skill gain, and procedural creature evolution.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to character progression, creature evolution, and dynamic difficulty.

------

#### The Law of Trophic Dynamics (ID: `LIFE-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that defines the **Energy Flow** among/by living entities, establishing the **Food Web** and **Ecological Balance**.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Trophic Dynamics
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `life eats life`. The `[life(-ing) BPMS]` is organized into **Trophic Levels**. Energy enters the system (Sun/Source), is captured by Producers, consumed by Consumers, and recycled by Decomposers. This flow dictates the population limits and behavior of all entities. No entity exists outside this chain.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Energy Pyramid]**

- **Production:** Generating value from the environment (Farming/Spawning).
- **Predation:** Transferring value by destroying another entity (Combat/Looting).
- **Loss:** Energy lost as heat/waste at each transfer (Entropy).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Ecosystem]**

The self-balancing nature of predator/prey populations.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*The big fish eats the little fish.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Ecology):**

This defines the economy of life. It governs spawn rates, loot drops, and faction warfare.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to ecosystem simulation, economy balance, and combat rewards.

------

#### The Axiom of Reproductive Continuity (ID: `LIFE-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines **Reproduction** as the mechanism for **Information Persistence** beyond the lifespan of a single instance.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Reproductive Continuity
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `the code must flow`. Individual instances of `[life(-ing) BPMS]` are transient (Mortality). **Reproduction** is the copying of the `[molecular(-ing) BPMS]` blueprint into a new instance, ensuring the survival of the *Pattern* even if the *Matter* dies. This allows for **Legacy** and **Iteration**.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Genetic Payload]**

- **Replication:** Copying the core logic/stats to a new entity.
- **Variation:** Introducing slight errors/changes (Mutation) to explore the search space.
- **Inheritance:** Passing down accumulated traits (Memories/Items/Stats) to the next generation.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Lineage]**

The history of a species or family line.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I live on in my children.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Genetics):**

The "Physics" of inheritance:

- **DNA:** Information storage and replication molecule.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Legacy" or "Nurture."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the long-term progression of the world. It explains respawning, rogue-lite mechanics, and dynasty systems.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to breeding systems, rogue-lite progression, and faction succession.

#### The Principle of Symbiotic Networking (ID: `LIFE-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that defines **Social Structures** and **Cooperation** as higher-order biological functions for survival.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Symbiotic Networking
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `no one survives alone`. **Symbiotic Networking** is the formation of beneficial bonds between living entities. This ranges from **Mutualism** (Trade/Party) to **Parasitism** (Theft/Debuff). Life naturally aggregates into **Super-Organisms** (Guilds/Cities) to solve problems too big for individuals.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Social Graph]**

- **Signaling:** Communication of intent and status (Emotes/Chat).
- **Bonding:** Formalizing relationships (Friend list/Alliance).
- **Emergent Roles:** Specialization within the group (Tank/Healer/DPS).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Society]**

The complex web of relationships and hierarchies.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Stronger together.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Sociology):**

The "Physics" of groups:

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Belonging" or "Duty."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the social layer of life. It governs reputation, party mechanics, and city simulation.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to NPC interaction, faction diplomacy, and multiplayer dynamics.

------

#### The Law of Homeostatic Regulation (ID: `LIFE-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that defines **Health** and **Status** as the maintenance of internal equilibrium against external chaos.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Homeostatic Regulation
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `balance is life`. **Homeostasis** is the active process of keeping system variables (HP, Mana, Stamina, Hunger) within viable ranges. **Disease** or **Damage** is the disruption of this balance. The `[life(-ing) BPMS]` constantly runs **Regulation Loops** to restore balance (Regeneration/Healing).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Feedback Controller]**

- **Sensor:** Detecting deviation from the setpoint (Pain/Low Battery).
- **Effector:** Taking action to correct the deviation (Eating/Resting).
- **Failure:** If deviation > Limit, the system crashes (Death).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Survival]**

The constant, low-level pressure to maintain needs.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Stay centered.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Control Theory):**

The "Physics" of regulation:

- **PID Controller:** Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller for maintaining a setpoint.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Comfort" or "Pain."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the survival mechanics. It governs HP/MP regeneration, status effects, and survival needs.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to health systems, survival meters, and status effect logic.

------

#### The Axiom of Sentient Projection (ID: `LIFE-CORE-007`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines **Sentience** as the ability of life to project a **Model of the Future** and act to bring it about.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Sentient Projection
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `life predicts`. **Sentience** is not just reacting to the present; it is simulating the future. The `[life(-ing) BPMS]` generates a **Virtual Future** (Plan/Desire) and uses its energy to collapse the **Actual Future** into that state. This is the origin of **Questing** and **Ambition**.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Prediction Engine]**

- **Simulation:** Running "What if?" scenarios based on memory.
- **Selection:** Choosing the scenario with the highest predicted reward.
- **Execution:** Performing actions to make the simulation real.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Will]**

The appearance of intent and purpose.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I dream, then I do.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Cognition):**

The "Physics" of planning:

- **Predictive Coding:** The brain is a prediction machine that updates its models based on error.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Hope" or "Determination."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the cognitive aspect of life. It governs AI goal-setting, pathfinding, and strategic planning.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to artificial intelligence behavior trees, quest generation, and strategic artificial intelligence.

------

#### The Principle of Ecological Succession (ID: `LIFE-CORE-008`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that defines the **Long-Term Evolution** of the entire living system, from **Pioneer** to **Climax** states.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Ecological Succession
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `life builds the stage for more life`. **Succession** is the process where simple life forms (Pioneers) alter the environment to make it suitable for complex life forms (Climax). The `[life(-ing) BPMS]` is not static; it progresses through stages of complexity, creating a **Living History** of the world.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Terraforming Loop]**

- **Colonization:** Hardy, simple entities enter an empty niche.
- **Modification:** Their life processes improve the environment (e.g., Soil formation).
- **Replacement:** More complex entities move in and outcompete the pioneers.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Civilization]**

The transition from wilderness to village to city to empire.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*We stand on the shoulders of giants.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Ecology):**

The "Physics" of succession:

- **Ecological Succession:** The process of change in the species structure of an ecological community over time.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Progress" or "History."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the dynamic world evolution. It governs biome changes, city growth, and narrative eras.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to dynamic world generation, civilization simulation, and narrative pacing.
