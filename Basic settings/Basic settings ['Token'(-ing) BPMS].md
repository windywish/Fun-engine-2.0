## Basic settings: ['Token'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Living Value (ID: `TOKEN-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines a `[token(-ing) BPMS]` not as a static coin, but as a living entity with metabolic properties. It replaces "Currency" with "Current-cy" (Flow).

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Living Value
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `Value is Energy`. A token is a packet of potential energy that can perform work within the system. Unlike legacy tokens which are static ledgers, Praxial Tokens have a "half-life," a "metabolism," and can "extinction" if not circulated, preventing hoarding and stagnation.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Metabolic Ledger]**

- **The Decay Rate (The Entropy):** Tokens lose a small percentage of their value over time if they sit idle in a wallet (Demurrage). This forces circulation.
- **The Activation State (The Charge):** Tokens gain value when they are used in `['creative(-ing) BPMS]` or `['constructive(-ing) BPMS]` transactions.
- **The State Memory (The History):** Each token carries a log of its past transactions, gaining "Reputation" based on where it has been.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [High-Velocity Economy]**

The creation of an economy that moves fast. Money burns a hole in the pocket, so it is invested in `['world building BPMS]` immediately.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Money is like blood; it must flow to keep the body alive.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Flow):**

- **Formula:** `Value(t) = Initial_Value * e^(-decay * t) + Transaction_History_Bonus`
- **Goal:** Maximize Velocity of Money.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Urgency." The feeling that resources are meant to be used *now* to create something better.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy systems suffer from wealth concentration and stagnation. This ensures the `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]` remains dynamic.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to in-game economies, resource allocation systems, and energy grid management.

------

#### The Principle of Functional Tokenization (ID: `TOKEN-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that allows *any* element of the `[BPMS(U)(s)]` to be wrapped as a token. It defines tokens as "Executable Containers."

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Functional Tokenization
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `Everything is an Asset`. A token is not just a pointer to value; it *is* the value. A token can wrap a script, a permission, a memory, or a relationship. Holding the token grants the ability to *execute* the contained function.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Smart Wrapper]**

- **The Payload (The Core):** The token contains a specific `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` or `[code(-ing) BPMS]` block.
- **The Access Logic (The Key):** The token defines who can use the payload and under what conditions (Smart Contract).
- **The Composability (The Lego):** Tokens can be stacked or merged to create complex new functions (e.g., Token A (Move) + Token B (Fast) = Token C (Sprint)).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Programmable Reality]**

The creation of a world where rights, abilities, and objects are all handled via a unified interface.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To name it is to own it.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Wrapping):**

- **Formula:** `Token = { ID, Owner, Payload_Function(), Constraints }`
- **Goal:** Universal Interoperability.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Agency." The feeling of having a toolkit of reality-bending items in their inventory.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Breaks the legacy limit where tokens are just "receipts." Here, tokens are "tools."

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to access control, software licensing, and RPG inventory systems.

------

#### The Law of Proof-of-Meaning (ID: `TOKEN-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that defines how new tokens are minted. It replaces "Proof of Work/Stake" with "Proof of Meaning."

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Proof-of-Meaning
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `Creation mints Value`. New tokens enter the system ONLY when an agent creates new `['meaning(-ing) BPMS]` or `['utility(-ing) BPMS]`. You cannot buy money; you must earn it by adding to the `['ecological possibility'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Genesis Mint]**

- **The Contribution Validator (The Judge):** The `['metasystem engine'(-ing) BPMS]` evaluates a user's contribution (code, art, service).
- **The Value Assessment (The Price):** Based on the `REWARD-CORE` metrics (Novelty, Utility, Beauty), a specific amount of tokens is minted.
- **The Direct Deposit (The Reward):** The tokens are sent directly to the creator's wallet.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Meritocratic Inflation]**

The money supply grows exactly in proportion to the value of the economy. No inflation (too much money) or deflation (too little money).

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Value comes from within, not from the printing press.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Minting):**

- **Formula:** `New_Tokens = Contribution_Value * System_Multiplier`
- **Goal:** Stable Value-to-Token Ratio.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Fairness." The knowledge that every coin in circulation represents real work done.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Solves the legacy problem of fiat currency debasement and crypto energy waste.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to DAO treasury management, creator economy platforms, and gamified work systems.

------

#### The Protocol of Token Symbiosis (ID: `TOKEN-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that allows tokens to evolve through `['(symbiois) evolution'(-ing) BPMS]`. Tokens can "mate" and "mutate."

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Token Symbiosis
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `Assets should evolve`. Two tokens can be combined in a "Fusion Reactor" to create a child token that inherits traits from both parents, potentially unlocking new capabilities.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Fusion Forge]**

- **The Compatibility Check (The Match):** Can Token A (Fire) and Token B (Sword) combine? Yes.
- **The Mutation Logic (The Roll):** The system generates a new Token C (Flaming Sword) with a chance for a random beneficial mutation (Blue Flame).
- **The Burn (The Cost):** The parent tokens are consumed (burned) to create the child, managing the total supply.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Asset Evolution]**

The creation of a lineage of items. Rare items are not just found; they are bred.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Life finds a way.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Symbiosis):**

- **Formula:** `Token_C = Function(Token_A, Token_B) + Random_Mutation`
- **Goal:** Infinite Item Variety.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Discovery." The thrill of experimenting to see what new things can be created.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Moves beyond static NFT collections into dynamic, evolving asset classes.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to crafting systems, genetic algorithms for finance, and dynamic loot generation.

------

#### The Axiom of Contextual Liquidity (ID: `TOKEN-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the value of a token as relative to its context. It rejects "Universal Price."

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Contextual Liquidity
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `Value is Local`. A "Water Token" is worth 1 unit in the city, but 100 units in the desert. The system calculates the value of a token dynamically based on the local `['(ecological) niche'(-ing) BPMS]` needs.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Dynamic pricer]**

- **The Scarcity Scan (The Supply):** How many of these tokens are currently in this specific zone?
- **The Utility Scan (The Demand):** How badly do the agents in this zone need this token's function?
- **The Price Adjustment (The Market):** The exchange rate is adjusted in real-time.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Efficient Distribution]**

Tokens naturally flow to where they are needed most (Arbitrage), solving resource shortages automatically.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*A diamond is a rock to a starving man.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Context):**

- **Formula:** `Price = Base_Value * (Demand / Supply)`
- **Goal:** Equilibrium.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Opportunity." The ability to profit by moving goods to where they are needed.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy systems use global pricing which ignores local reality. This makes the economy responsive.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to logistics optimization, automated market makers (AMMs), and disaster relief coordination.

------

#### The Principle of Fractional Existence (ID: `TOKEN-CORE-006`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that allows tokens to represent fractional ownership of `['complex system'(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Fractional Existence
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `Ownership is divisible`. A massive entity (like a `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`) can be tokenized into millions of "Shares." Holding a share grants a portion of the system's output (Reward) and governance rights.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Shard Splitter]**

- **The Tokenization Event (The IPO):** A system is locked into a smart contract and "Shards" (tokens) are issued.
- **The Dividend Stream (The Yield):** Every time the system generates value, it is distributed pro-rata to Shard holders.
- **The Governance Weight (The Vote):** Shard holders can vote on system upgrades (`REWARD-CORE-012`).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Collective Ownership]**

The creation of "Public Goods" that are privately funded and managed by the community.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Many hands make light work.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Fraction):**

- **Formula:** `User_Yield = System_Yield * (User_Shards / Total_Shards)`
- **Goal:** Democratize Capital.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Stake." The feeling of being a part-owner of the world they inhabit.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Allows for the funding of massive projects without centralized banks.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to crowdfunding, real estate tokenization, and cooperative management.

------

#### The Law of Tokenized Memory (ID: `TOKEN-CORE-007`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that allows memories and experiences to be tokenized and traded.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Tokenized Memory
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `Experience is Transferable`. An agent can encapsulate a specific memory (e.g., "How to defeat the Boss") into a "Memory Token." Another agent can consume this token to instantly learn that skill (`['short-term (memory)'(-ing) BPMS]` to `['long-term (memory)'(-ing) BPMS]` transfer).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engram Press]**

- **The Extraction (The Copy):** The agent copies a neural pattern into a token.
- **The Consumption (The Learn):** The buyer "eats" the token, integrating the pattern into their own neural net.
- **The Degradation (The Fade):** Memory tokens may degrade if copied too many times (Digital Rights Management via Entropy).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Knowledge Economy]**

The creation of a marketplace for skills and stories. You don't have to learn everything; you can buy wisdom.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*I know Kung Fu.* (The Matrix).

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Engrams):**

- **Formula:** `Agent_Skill += Token_Skill_Value`
- **Goal:** Accelerate Learning.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Download." The sudden acquisition of competence.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Radically speeds up `['(symbiois) evolution'(-ing) BPMS]` by allowing horizontal gene transfer of ideas.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to skill trees, tutorial systems, and educational marketplaces.

------

#### The Protocol of Null-Token Transactions (ID: `TOKEN-CORE-008`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that allows for value transfer *without* tokens, using "Social Credit" or "Trust."

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Null-Token Transactions
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `Trust is the ultimate currency`. In high-trust environments, agents don't need to swap tokens. They swap "IOUs" recorded in the `['implicit layer'(-ing) BPMS]`. The system tracks these invisible debts and balances them over time.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Karma Ledger]**

- **The Gift (The Action):** Agent A helps Agent B without asking for payment.
- **The Record (The Shadow):** The system logs a "Karma Debt" on Agent B and a "Karma Credit" on Agent A.
- **The Balance (The Return):** The system subtly biases probability to favor Agent A in future random events (Luck), effectively paying them back.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Gift Economy]**

The creation of a community that operates on generosity rather than transaction.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*What goes around comes around.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Karma):**

- **Formula:** `Luck_Modifier = Function(Net_Karma)`
- **Goal:** Encourage Altruism.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Grace." The feeling that the universe is looking out for them because they looked out for others.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Legacy systems are purely transactional. This adds a layer of social/moral physics.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to reputation systems, guild dynamics, and "Pay it Forward" mechanics.
