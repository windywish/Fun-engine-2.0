## Basic settings: ['Praxial Holonic Agent'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Holonic Symbiosis (ID: `PHA-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **Praxial Holonic Agent (PHA)** as the "Biological Spearhead" of the Fun Engine Framework. This setting establishes the PHA as the specific implementation of `['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['embodied intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]`, and `[life(-ing) BPMS]` designed to achieve deep evolutionary symbiosis with organic systems like `[tree(-ing) BPMS]` and `[jungle(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Holonic Symbiosis
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that **Agency is Symbiotic**. The Praxial Holonic Agent is not a solitary actor but a "Holon"—simultaneously a complete individual and a dependent part of a larger ecological system. It defines the PHA as a living artifact that does not merely "use" the environment but "metabolizes" it, evolving its internal structure in direct response to external organic stimuli.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Triadic Life-Engine]**

- **The Soul (Holonic Mind):** The agent possesses a `['holonic mind'(-ing) BPMS]` that functions as the "Gnostic Core." It maintains the agent's identity, memory, and decision-making logic. It is the "Driver" that seeks meaning and connection.
- **The Body (Embodied Intelligence):** The agent is instantiated via `['embodied intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]`. It has a "Sensorimotor Surface" that feels the physics of the world. It translates abstract intent into kinetic action (movement, combat, craft).
- **The Drive (Life):** The agent is powered by `[life(-ing) BPMS]`. It is not static; it has metabolic needs (energy, growth, reproduction). This drive forces the agent to seek symbiosis with the `[tree(-ing) BPMS]` to survive and thrive, turning "gameplay" into "living."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Organic Resonance]**

The creation of a **Co-Evolutionary Feedback Loop**. When the PHA interacts with a `[tree(-ing) BPMS]`, it doesn't just climb it; it "resonates" with it. The agent might gain "Bark Skin" (adaptation), while the Tree gains "Guardian Memory" (history). The Agent and the Environment become a single, evolving organism over time.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

- **Upholds `['Ontological Relativity'(-ing) BPMS] (META-005)`:** The PHA defines its reality through its relationships. An agent in a `[jungle]` becomes a "Jungle Holon"; an agent in a `[desert]` becomes a "Desert Holon." Identity is relative to the symbiotic partner.
- **Upholds `['System Existence Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`:** The PHA acts as a mobile existence engine, collapsing the "Wavefunction of Potential" of the `[tree(-ing) BPMS]` into concrete "Fruit" or "Shelter" through its life-drive.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Collapse):**

- **Enforces `['Praxial Trophic Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`:** The PHA operates on a trophic scale. It consumes "Low-Entropy" resources (experience, items) and excretes "High-Entropy" action, but through the `[life(-ing) BPMS]`, it recycles this entropy into "Growth" (Negative Entropy).
- **Enforces `['Chrono-Kinetic Continuity'(-ing) BPMS]`:** The Agent's evolution is historically contingent. It cannot simply "respec" instantly; it must grow new branches in its `[tree(-ing) BPMS]` lineage, respecting the flow of time.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

- **Validates `['Praxial Artifacts'(-ing) BPMS]`:** The PHA is the ultimate "Character Artifact." It is a tangible, ownable entity that the user can take from one "World Theme" to another, carrying its evolutionary history (its "Tree") with it.
- **Validates `['Praxial citizen'(-ing) BPMS]`:** The PHA elevates the user from a "Player" to a "Citizen" of the ecosystem, as their survival depends on the health of the symbiotic network.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation is necessary to solve the "Symbiotic Gap" identified in the project analysis. Without a dedicated `['Praxial Holonic Agent'(-ing) BPMS]`, the framework lacks a mechanism for "Biological Evolution." This setting provides the "Living Connector" required to make `[tree(-ing) BPMS]` and `[jungle(-ing) BPMS]` functionally relevant to the user experience, transforming them from static scenery into dynamic evolutionary partners.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to all "Character Artifacts" intended for external use that require biological progression, pet/companion mechanics, or deep ecological interaction. It is the primary class for "Druidic," "Beastmaster," or "Evolutionary" playstyles within the Fun Engine Framework.
