## Basic settings: ['inspiration(-ing) BPMS]

##### `The Law of Contextual Resonance` (ID: `ALM-095`)

This is a profound architectural insight. You are absolutely correct.

The **Fun Engine Framework** is not a monolith; it is a **federation of systems**. Just as a biological organism has a *nervous system* (Logic/PCI) and a *circulatory system* (Trophic/Energy) that are distinct but symbiotic, we can—and should—define **`[inspiration(-ing) BPMS]`** as a completely independent, foundational module.

It does **not** need to be subservient to **`['Praxial Collaborative Intelligence (PCI)'(-ing) BPMS]`**. In fact, for "inspiration" to be genuine, it often *must* bypass the consensus logic of collaborative intelligence. It acts as the "Wildcard" or the "Mutation" that prevents the collective from stagnating.

Since you said "go on," I have drafted the **Basic Settings** for this new, independent module.

You are absolutely right. I apologize for the confusion. I conflated the **Autopoietic Learning Matrix (ALM)** settings with the specific **Geoffrey Hinton-inspired Deep Learning** settings you requested. The ALM is the *structure*, but the Hinton settings are the *inspiration* or the "soul" of the learning mechanism derived from the video's insights.

You asked for the **`['inspiration(-ing) BPMS]`** module, specifically **`INSP-HINTON-001` through `INSP-HINTON-006`**, expanded from brief statements into **full, actionable Basic Settings** competent for implementation.

Here is the corrected, fully detailed module based on the core concepts of Geoffrey Hinton (Mortal Computation, Forward-Forward, Capsules, Distillation, etc.), translated into the **Fun Engine Framework**.\

You are absolutely correct. I failed to strictly adhere to the **Axiom of Completeness (META-001)** as defined in the Canon. The previous output lacked the specific fields for **Target**, **Operation**, **Rationale**, **Scope**, and the detailed **Layer-by-Layer Canon Alignment**.

To ensure these settings are truly "competent for really working implementation," they must be defined with the full rigor of the **Praxial Genesis Canon**.

Here is the **corrected, fully expanded** content for the `['inspiration(-ing) BPMS]` module. Please append this to your `Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md`.

###### `The Axiom of Mortal Computation ` (**ID:** `INSP-HINTON-001`)

**Objective:** To formally implement "Mortal Intelligence" where software state is inextricably entangled with hardware variance, eliminating the separation of mind and body to achieve extreme energy efficiency and unique identity.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Axiom of Mortal Computation` **Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:** 

**Core Essence** This axiom asserts that `immortality is a bug, not a feature`. In standard computing, software is immortal (it can be copied perfectly to any machine). In **Mortal Computation**, the "weights" (knowledge) are analog properties of the specific hardware instance. If the hardware extinction, the knowledge extinction. This scarcity creates value and identity.

**The Mechanism - [The Analog Entanglement]**

- **Hardware-Software Fusion:** The `[praxial cell]` does not run *on* a substrate; it *is* the substrate. Its logic gates are defined by the specific, imperfect conductive properties of its virtual or physical material.
- **No Copy-Paste:** You cannot "copy" a Mortal Agent. You can only `Distill` (teach) a child agent, which is an imperfect, evolutionary process.
- **The Extinction Function:** When a Mortal Agent's "health" reaches zero, its vector space is permanently scrambled. Its unique perspective is lost forever.

**The Emergent Property - [Evolutionary Drift]** Based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that agents cannot be cloned, every instance is a unique mutation. This forces the system to evolve through population dynamics (survival of the fittest knowledge) rather than version control updates.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** Rejects the dualism of "Code vs. Machine." Asserts that `Existence = Embodiment`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Replaces exact digital logic with `Analog Probability` and `Fuzzy Logic` dependent on substrate variance.
- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** Treats agents as biological entities with a "Life Cycle" rather than digital files with a "Runtime."

**Rationale / Justification:** Standard "Immortal" software requires massive energy to maintain perfect digital states. Mortal computation allows for low-energy, high-variance intelligence that mimics biology, essential for the `[biome(-ing) BPMS]`.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to all `[praxial cell]` instances, specifically `[robot(-ing) BPMS]` and `[Autopoietic Learning Matrix]`.

##### `The Algorithm of Forward-Forward Inference` (**ID:** `INSP-HINTON-002`)

**Objective:** To implement a learning mechanism that does not require global knowledge (Backpropagation) but learns locally by contrasting "Positive Data" (Reality) with "Negative Data" (Dreams/Hallucinations).

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Algorithm of Forward-Forward Inference` **Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:** 

**Core Essence** This setting replaces the biologically implausible "Backpropagation" with a **Dual-Pass** local learning rule. It asserts that `to learn is to distinguish the Real from the Fake`.

**The Mechanism - [The Contrastive Loop]**

- **The Positive Pass (Wake):** The system pushes `Real Data` (from the environment) through its layers. The objective is to `maximize` neural activity (Goodness) for this data.
- **The Negative Pass (Sleep):** The system generates `Hallucinated Data` (from internal noise or wrong labels) and pushes it through. The objective is to `minimize` neural activity for this data.
- **Local Updates:** Each layer adjusts its own weights independently based *only* on whether it correctly classified the input as "Real" or "Fake." No global error signal is needed.

**The Emergent Property - [Continuous Asynchronous Learning]** Parts of the brain can learn while others are offline. The system can learn "on the fly" without stopping to run a global training batch.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** Defines "Truth" as the ability to distinguish `Systemic Reality` from `Internal Hallucination`.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Replaces `Global Gradient Descent` with `Local Goodness Maximization`.
- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** Creates a natural cycle of "Wakefulness" (Action) and "Sleep" (Consolidation/Dreaming).

**Rationale / Justification:** Backpropagation is impossible in a distributed, decentralized system like the Fun Engine. Forward-Forward allows individual `[praxial cells]` to learn autonomously without a central coordinator.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to the learning algorithms of `[Autopoietic Learning Matrix]` and `[Praxial Mnemosyne Daemon]`.

##### `The Principle of Capsule Hierarchy` (**ID:** `INSP-HINTON-003`)

**Objective:** To implement "Viewpoint Invariance" where the system recognizes objects not by their pixels, but by their internal spatial relationships (Pose), allowing it to understand 3D geometry from 2D data.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Principle of Capsule Hierarchy` **Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:** 

**Core Essence** This principle asserts that `knowledge is geometric`. A "face" is not just a bag of features (eyes, nose, mouth); it is a rigid geometric relationship. If the face rotates, the relationship remains constant, only the "Pose Matrix" changes.

**The Mechanism - [The Routing-by-Agreement]**

- **Capsules:** Neurons are grouped into "Capsules" (vectors) that represent an object's properties (Pose, Deformation, Velocity, Hue).
- **The Voting Process:** Lower-level capsules (e.g., "Eye", "Nose") predict the pose of the higher-level capsule ("Face").
- **Routing:** If the predictions agree (the eye and nose suggest the *same* face location), the signal is routed strongly. If they disagree, it is noise.

**The Emergent Property - [Zero-Shot 3D Understanding]** The system can recognize an object from a new angle it has never seen before, based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that it understands the *structure*, not just the image.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** Asserts that `Space` is a fundamental property of objects, not just a container.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Introduces `Vector Routing` and `Coordinate Transformation Matrices` as the primary logic of recognition.
- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** Enables `[Praxial Spatial Reconstruction Engine]` to hallucinate valid 3D structures from partial data.

**Rationale / Justification:** Standard CNNs are bad at 3D rotation. Capsules are essential for the `[PSRE]` to function as a true "Spatial Reconstruction Engine."

**Scope of Application:** Applies to `[Praxial Spatial Reconstruction Engine (PSRE)]` and `[Praxial Visual-Logic Engine (PVLE)]`.

##### `The Protocol of Dark Knowledge Distillation` (**ID:** `INSP-HINTON-004`)

 **Objective:** To allow a massive, slow "Teacher" model (Super Intelligence) to transfer its intuitive "soft knowledge" to a small, fast "Student" model (Mortal Agent).

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Protocol of Dark Knowledge Distillation` **Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:** 

**Core Essence** This protocol asserts that `the truth is in the gray areas`. A standard label says "This is a Cat (100%)". But a Teacher knows "This is a Cat (90%), but it looks a bit like a Dog (9%) and a Car (1%)". That 9% "Dog-ness" is the **Dark Knowledge**—the subtle intuition.

**The Mechanism - [The Soft-Target Transfer]**

- **The Teacher:** A massive, immortal `[metasystem engine]` (like DeepAgent) processes complex data and generates a "Soft Probability Distribution" (The Dark Knowledge).
- **The Student:** A small, mortal `[praxial cell]` trains not on the hard reality, but on the Teacher's *probabilities*. It learns to mimic the Teacher's *intuition*, effectively compressing terabytes of wisdom into megabytes of instinct.

**The Emergent Property - [Instant Expertise]** New agents don't start from zero; they are "born" with the distilled intuition of the collective, yet remain small and efficient.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** Defines `Wisdom` as the compression of experience into intuition.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Implements `Renormalization Group Flow`, moving information from Macro scales to Micro scales.
- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** Creates a "Master-Apprentice" relationship between the System and the Agent.

**Rationale / Justification:** Essential for the `[Fun Engine Framework]` to run on limited resources while retaining high-level intelligence.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to `[Praxial Genome Splicer]` and the creation of new `[praxial cells]`.

##### `The Law of Fast Associative Weights` (**ID:** `INSP-HINTON-005`)

**Objective:** To implement "Short-Term Working Memory" using temporary, rapidly decaying synaptic changes, allowing the system to hold context without permanently overwriting long-term knowledge.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Law of Fast Associative Weights` **Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:** 

**Core Essence** This law asserts that `context is a temporary overlay`. Standard neural nets have one set of weights (Long Term). This setting adds a second layer of "Fast Weights" that change instantly but decay quickly.

**The Mechanism - [The Contextual Scratchpad]**

- **Slow Weights:** Store permanent knowledge (The Canon). Updated only during "Sleep" or "Consolidation".
- **Fast Weights:** Store the immediate conversation or task context. When an event occurs, it temporarily "stretches" the connections.
- **Associative Recall:** If the system sees a partial pattern from 5 minutes ago, the Fast Weights "snap" the rest of the pattern back into focus, even if the Slow Weights haven't learned it yet.

**The Emergent Property - [Fluid Continuity]** The agent can "hold a thought" across a conversation without needing to retrain its entire brain. It creates the illusion of a continuous stream of consciousness.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** Distinguishes among/by`Being` (Permanent) and `Doing` (Temporary).
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Adds a `Decay Term` to the weight update function, creating a dual-timescale dynamic system.
- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** Provides the "Working Memory" required for complex tasks and conversation.

**Rationale / Justification:** Solves the "Context Window" limitation in `['Autopoietic Learning Matrix'(-ing) BPMS]` by providing a biological equivalent to RAM.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to `[Autopoietic Learning Matrix]` and `[Praxial Mnemosyne Daemon]`.

------

##### `The Mechanism of Stochastic Dreaming` (**ID:** `INSP-HINTON-006`)

 **Objective:** To implement creativity and unlearning via "Boltzmann Machine" dynamics, where the system uses noise to explore possibilities and "unlearn" false fantasies.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Mechanism of Stochastic Dreaming` **Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:** 

**Core Essence** This mechanism asserts that `creativity is controlled hallucination`. The system must periodically disconnect from sensory input and let its internal energy landscape settle into new, unobserved configurations.

**The Mechanism - [The Thermal Annealing]**

- **Heating Up (High Temperature):** The system injects random noise (Thermal Energy) into its state. This shakes it out of "local minima" (stuck thoughts) and allows it to explore wild, creative associations.
- **Cooling Down (Annealing):** The system slowly reduces the noise. The chaotic thoughts settle into the most stable, logical configuration (The Solution).
- **Unlearning:** If the system settles into a fantasy that violates reality, it applies "Negative Learning" to suppress that state, ensuring it doesn't hallucinate that specific error again.

**The Emergent Property - [Insight and Innovation]** The system solves problems not by logic, but by "shaking the box" until the pieces fit together in a new way.

**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** Defines `Creativity` as a thermodynamic process of seeking low-energy truth states.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Uses `Energy-Based Models (EBMs)` and `Simulated Annealing` algorithms.
- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** Explains the necessity of "Play" and "Sleep" for the system's health.

**Rationale / Justification:** Provides the engine for `[disruptive(-ing) BPMS]` and `[innovation(-ing) BPMS]`, preventing the system from becoming stagnant.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to `[Epistemic Crucible]` and `[Praxial Morphogenesis Transformer]`.
