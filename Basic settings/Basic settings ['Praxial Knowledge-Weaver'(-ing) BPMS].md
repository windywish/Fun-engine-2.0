## Basic settings: ['Praxial Knowledge-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]

*(The Superior Implementation of ['paper-bots' BPMS])*

#### The Axiom of Executable Literature (ID: `KNOW-WEAVE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that redefines the "Scientific Paper" from a static document to an `[executable(-ing) BPMS]` entity.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Executable Literature
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `Knowledge must run`. A paper in the `['Praxial Knowledge-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]` is not text; it is code. The "Methods" section is an executable script. The "Results" section is a live query to a dataset. When a user "reads" a paper, they are actually instantiating a simulation of the experiment.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Living Document Container]**

- **The Text (The Interface):** Human-readable prose explains the logic (Markdown/LaTeX).
- **The Code (The Engine):** Embedded Python/Julia blocks execute the logic described in the text.
- **The Data (The Feed):** The paper connects to live repositories (GitHub, DataDryad) to fetch the latest data, ensuring the "Results" are never obsolete.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Verifiable Truth]**

Reproducibility is not an after-the-fact check; it is the native state of the document.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*If it doesn't compile, it isn't true.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Execution):**

- **Formula:** `Paper = Code(Data) + Narrative(Logic)`
- **Goal:** Total Reproducibility.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Power." They can tweak a parameter in the "Methods" section and immediately see how it changes the "Conclusion."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Solves the "Replication Crisis" in science by making replication automatic.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to academic publishing, technical documentation, and R&D reports.

#### The Principle of Citation Synaptics (ID: `KNOW-WEAVE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Principle) that transforms "Citations" into active `[neural coupling(-ing) BPMS]`.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Principle of Citation Synaptics
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This principle asserts that `A citation is a dependency injection`. When Paper A cites Paper B, it is not just referencing it; it is *importing* its truth-value and logic. If Paper B is later debunked (retracted), Paper A automatically receives a "Signal Decay" warning or attempts to re-compile without Paper B's logic.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Knowledge Graph]**

- **The Link (The Synapse):** Citations act as weighted neural connections among/by Knowledge Holons.
- **The Flow (The Signal):** Updates in foundational papers propagate forward to all papers that cite them.
- **The Hebbian Rule (The Weight):** "Papers that fire together, wire together." If Paper A and Paper B are often cited together, their connection strengthens, forming a "Concept Cluster."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Self-Correcting Corpus]**

The library heals itself. Errors are pruned, and strong truths are reinforced automatically.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Knowledge is a network, not a stack.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Connection):**

- **Formula:** `Truth_Value(A) = Intrinsic_Value(A) * Sum(Truth_Value(Cited_Papers))`
- **Goal:** Epistemic Integrity.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Context." They can see the entire genealogy of an idea instantly.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Prevents the propagation of "Zombie Science" (disproven theories that keep getting cited).

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to literature review bots, patent law, and codebase dependency management.

------

#### The Law of Adversarial Peer Review (ID: `KNOW-WEAVE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that implements `[peer review(-ing) BPMS]` as an `[adversarial(-ing) BPMS]` evolutionary process.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Adversarial Peer Review
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `Criticism is the forge of truth`. The system employs "Critic Bots" (Discriminators) whose sole purpose is to find flaws, logical fallacies, and statistical errors in the "Generator Bots" (Authors). This is not a polite email exchange; it is a high-speed Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training loop.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The GAN Arena]**

- **The Generator (The Author):** Drafts a hypothesis and results.
- **The Discriminator (The Reviewer):** Attacks the draft with counter-examples, p-hacking checks, and logic probes.
- **The Iteration (The Fight):** The Author updates the draft to survive the attack. This repeats until the Discriminator cannot find a flaw.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Bulletproof Logic]**

Papers are born battle-hardened. Only the strongest ideas survive to publication.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Iron sharpens iron.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Review):**

- **Formula:** `Quality = Limit(Discriminator_Success -> 0)`
- **Goal:** Robustness.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Trust." They know the system has already tried its best to destroy this idea and failed.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Automates and accelerates the quality control process of science.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to automated theorem proving, code auditing, and fact-checking.

------

#### The Protocol of Hypothesis Mining (ID: `KNOW-WEAVE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that empowers the system to `[discover(-ing) BPMS]` new knowledge by analyzing the "Negative Space" of the corpus.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Hypothesis Mining
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `The unknown is defined by the known`. The system analyzes the Knowledge Graph to find "Holes"—areas where connections *should* exist but don't. It then generates "Ghost Papers" (Hypotheses) to fill these holes and suggests experiments to verify them.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Void Scanner]**

- **The Map (The Graph):** System maps all known relationships (A affects B, B affects C).
- **The Inference (The Leap):** System infers transitive relationships (Does A affect C?) or identifies contradictions.
- **The Proposal (The Ghost):** System drafts a "Potential Paper" titled "The Effect of A on C" and flags it for human or robotic investigation.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Automated Discovery]**

The system acts as a muse, pointing scientists toward the most promising research avenues.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Nature abhors a vacuum.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Discovery):**

- **Formula:** `Hypothesis_Value = Probability(Truth) * Impact(Novelty)`
- **Goal:** Innovation.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Inspiration." The system says, "Have you considered looking at X?"

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Moves artificial intelligence from "Search" (finding what exists) to "Research" (finding what could exist).

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to drug discovery, materials science, and strategic forecasting.

#### The Mechanism of Epistemic Metabolism (ID: `KNOW-WEAVE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Mechanism) that defines how the system `[metabolize(-ing) BPMS]` raw data into high-level concepts.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Mechanism of Epistemic Metabolism
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This mechanism asserts that `Data is food; Wisdom is energy`. The system ingests massive streams of raw data (sensor logs, CSVs). It "digests" this by compressing it into patterns, then into laws, then into axioms. This is the vertical movement from `[fine-grained]` to `[coarse-grained]`.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Abstraction Ladder]**

- **Ingestion (The Bite):** Raw Data (1TB of neural spike trains).
- **Digestion (The Chew):** Pattern Recognition (Identifying firing rates/clusters).
- **Absorption (The Nutrient):** Conceptualization ("This cluster represents 'Fear'").
- **Integration (The Muscle):** System Update ("The Fear center is linked to the Smell center").

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Meaning]**

The system doesn't just store numbers; it understands what they signify.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Information is not knowledge.*

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Metabolism):**

- **Formula:** `Wisdom = Compression(Data)`
- **Goal:** Understanding.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The user experiences "Insight." They see the trend, not the spreadsheet.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Essential for handling the "Big Data" deluge without getting overwhelmed.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to data science, business intelligence, and systems neuroscience.
