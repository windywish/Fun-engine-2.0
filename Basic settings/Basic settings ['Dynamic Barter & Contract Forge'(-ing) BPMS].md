### Basic settings: ['Dynamic Barter & Contract Forge'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Law of Negotiated Worth (ID: `DBCF-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that replaces the scalar concept of "price" with **Dynamic Barter**, establishing that value is a context-dependent agreement between specific agents.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Negotiated Worth
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `value is a conversation`. There is no universal price tag. The "cost" of a service is determined by a bespoke `Dynamic Symbiotic Contract` that balances the specific needs, risks, and offers of the participants in that exact moment.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Deal Engine]**

- **The Projection (The Offer):** Agents project a `Multi-Dimensional Utility Model` (e.g., "I offer 50 Gold + Protection + My Reputation").
- **The Negotiation (The Dance):** The `Automated Negotiation Engine` searches the `Possibility Space` for a Pareto-optimal compromise, iterating through thousands of potential contract structures in milliseconds.
- **The Agreement (The Handshake):** The `Symbiotic Contract Instantiator` forges the final terms into a binding `Rule Set`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Smart Contract]**

The creation of "Living Agreements" that can self-execute, self-enforce, and even evolve if the context changes, replacing static transactions with dynamic relationships.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Fairness is Local.* What is fair in one context is exploitation in another. The system must find the local optimum.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Exchange):**

- **If `[trade(-ing) BPMS]`: (Barter Logic)** "I give you Wood; you give me Stone." (Simple Swap).
- **If `[service(-ing) BPMS]`: (Future Logic)** "I heal you now; you give me 10% of the loot later." (Risk Sharing).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "The Deal." The satisfaction of crafting a unique agreement that feels like a personal victory, rather than just clicking "Buy."

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Replaces the `price BPMS`. In a complex system, "Gold" is a poor proxy for value. This setting allows for complex, interesting social interactions (favors, debts, alliances) to be codified as system mechanics.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to trading, quest generation, mercenary contracts, and diplomatic treaties.
