## Basic settings: ['Symbiotic Capability Fusion'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Law of Synergistic Fusion (ID: `SCF-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that replaces the concept of "circulation" with **Symbiotic Capability Fusion**, defining collaboration as the creation of a new, emergent subject rather than the mere exchange of objects.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Synergistic Fusion
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `1 + 1 > 2`. It defines a collaborative act not as two agents trading goods, but as two agents temporarily merging their `Functional Potentialities` to form a new, higher-order `Holon`. The "Team" is a distinct entity with capabilities that neither member possesses alone.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Fusion Reactor]**

- **The Discovery (The Match):** The `Capability Discovery Engine` scans `Synergistic Value Ledgers` to find complementary skills (e.g., "I have a Sword" + "You have a Shield").
- **The Simulation (The Vetting):** The `Synergy Simulation Engine` runs a "Fermi Problem" in a sandbox to predict if this fusion will result in success or `dissipation`.
- **The Binding (The Lock):** The `Holon Formation Protocol` creates a temporary membrane around the agents, synchronizing their `Input/Output BPMS`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Super-Agent]**

The spontaneous emergence of a `Collaborative Holon` (e.g., a "Raid Party" or "Research Group") that acts as a single `System Vector` with a unified will and amplified power.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*Unity is Power.* The fundamental unit of action in the Fun Engine is not the individual, but the relationship.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Union):**

- **If `[combat(-ing) BPMS]`: (Tactical Fusion)** Tank + Healer = `[Immortal_Vanguard_Holon]`.
- **If `[creation(-ing) BPMS]`: (Artistic Fusion)** Writer + Illustrator = `[Graphic_Novel_Holon]`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Flow." The dissolution of the ego into the group task, where action and reaction become instantaneous and intuitive.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Replaces the sterile `circulation BPMS`. In a Fun Engine, players don't just pass items around; they combine forces to do cool things. This law formalizes that "combining forces."

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to party formation, guild mechanics, joint crafting, and multi-agent artificial intelligence problem solving.
