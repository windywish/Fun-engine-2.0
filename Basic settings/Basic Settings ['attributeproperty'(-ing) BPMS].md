## **Basic Settings: ['attribute/property'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **The Axiom of Intrinsic State (ID: `TYP-CORE-001`)**

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **`['attribute/property'(-ing) BPMS]`** as the fundamental **Generative Archetype of Intrinsic State Description**, establishing the "Atomic Facts" of the System Matrix.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Intrinsic State
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `being is a measurable quantity`. It defines the `attribute/property BPMS` not as a passive label, but as the active **`Generative Archetype`** that collapses the "Potentiality Cloud" of a quality into a definite, quantifiable `Atomic Fact` (e.g., Mass, Color, Value).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Quantification]**

- **The State Measurement Engine (The Engine of "What Is It?"):** The `bottom-up` process where an `observer BPMS` interacts with a `System Vector`, collapsing a superposition of qualities into a specific value.
- **The Property Instantiation Engine (The Engine of "Now It Is Known"):** The `constructive` process that forges a permanent `Matrix Mapping` in the `explicit layer`: `[System_Vector; {Has_Attribute}; {Value}]`.
- **The State Manifold (The Structure of "The Thing Itself"):** The complete, evolving `Blueprint` of all attributes associated with a `System Vector`, serving as the raw data for `Sensemaking`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Describable Universe]**

The creation of a "High-Fidelity Reality" where every entity has a defined, measurable state. This allows the `System Matrix` to be not just experienced, but *known* and *recorded* in the `Correlational History`.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**

*To be is to have properties.* Existence requires differentiation through measurable qualities.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Description):**

The "Physics" of property assignment is defined by the `Attribute Archetype`:

- **Universal Sensorium:** The system achieves `Super Intelligence` by designing `perception BPMS` capable of measuring any conceivable attribute.
- **Symbiotic Definition:** `[Agent; {Possesses}; State_Manifold] = {Describable_Entity_Holon}`.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Clarity." The transition from vague awareness to precise knowledge (e.g., "It is heavy" becomes "It is 10kg").

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Derived from the "Paradigm of Intrinsic State" in `Settings for Typical [BPMS(U)(s)]_2.md`. It provides the foundational "adjectives" of reality required for any `Sensemaking` or `Interaction` to occur.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to all `System Vectors`, `Holons`, and `Agents` within the Fun Engine Framework.
