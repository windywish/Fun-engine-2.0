## Basic settings: `['social collaboration'(-ing) BPMS]`

*(Expansion: Integrating The Paradigm of Symbiotic Weaving)*

#### The Law of Resonance Exchange (ID: `SOC-WEAVE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that replaces transactional trade with **Resonance Exchange**, defining collaboration as a positive-sum weaving of potentialities.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Resonance Exchange
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that **Value is Flow, not Hoard**. It defines the `['social collaboration'(-ing) BPMS]` as the **Generative Archetype of Synergistic Collaboration**. It abolishes the zero-sum game of "Trade" (I lose X, you gain X) and replaces it with the infinite-sum game of "Co-Weaving" (We combine X and Y to create Z, which is greater than X+Y).

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Co-Creative Loom]**

- **The Field (Marketplace):** The `Potentiality & Inquiry Resonance Field` replaces the price-list. Agents broadcast "Songs" of Intent (Needs) and Potentiality (Skills). The field matches them based on harmonic resonance, not keyword search.
- **The Loom (Workspace):** The `Co-Creative Loom` is the shared habitat where matched agents "Jam." They improvise and weave their assets together.
- **The Yield (Paycheck):** The `Holistic Yield & Reputation Synthesizer` measures the *total* value generated (Utility + Joy + Resilience) and distributes it not as currency, but as "Reputation" written directly to the agents' `Synergistic Value Ledgers`.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Synergistic Abundance]**

The emergence of a "High-Trust Habitat" where the optimal strategy for individual gain is maximizing collective contribution. The system naturally selects for generosity and synergy.

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

Upholds **`['System Existence Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`** by positing that relationships themselves are entities that must be "woven" into existence.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):**

Enforces **`['Praxial Trophic Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`** by defining a non-entropic energy exchange (Synergy) where output energy > input energy (conceptually).

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):**

Validates **`['Praxial citizen'(-ing) BPMS]`** by providing the "Social Physics" that govern how citizens interact and grow.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

Derived from the "Paradigm of Symbiotic Weaving" in `Settings for Typical [BPMS(U)(s)]_3.md`. This is critical for the "Fun Engine" to operate as a post-scarcity, creativity-focused framework rather than a transactional economy.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to team formation, open-source contribution models, reputation systems, matchmaking algorithms, and collaborative storytelling mechanics.
