## Basic settings: ['Voyager'(-ing) BPMS]

#### The Axiom of Code-As-Action (ID: `VOYAGER-CORE-001`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting that defines **Voyager** as the **System-2 Reasoning Engine**, complementing NitroGen by providing long-horizon planning, curriculum learning, and symbolic tool construction.

#### **3. Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Code-As-Action
```

#### **4. Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### **5. New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `to think is to code`. Unlike NitroGen, which outputs raw motor commands (buttons), Voyager outputs **Executable Code** (Skills). It defines the "Mind" of the agent as a library of self-written programs that manipulate the world.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Iterative Prompting Loop]**

- **The Automatic Curriculum:** The system does not wait for commands. It autonomously generates its own "Mission" based on the `['foraging BPMS]` principle (e.g., "I see wood; I should make a crafting table").
- **The Skill Library (The Grimoire):** When the agent solves a problem, it writes a Python/GDScript function to encapsulate that solution. This function is stored in a vector database (`['Praxial Knowledge Weave (PKW)'(-ing) BPMS]`).
- **The Self-Correction:** If the code fails (runtime error or logic error), the system reads the error message, reflects, and re-writes the code. This is **"Execution-Based Feedback."**

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Lifelong Learning]**

The agent gets smarter the longer it lives. Its "Skill Library" grows, allowing it to compose complex behaviors (e.g., "Build House") from atomic skills (e.g., "Place Block", "Craft Plank").

#### **6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1):**

- **`['Praxial Logos'(-ing) BPMS]`**: "The Code is the Word made Flesh." Voyager literally writes the logos (code) that governs its praxis.

#### **6.2. Formal Stratum (Layer 2):**

- **`['Praxial Trophic Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`**: Voyager "eats" complexity. It consumes novel problems and excretes solved skills.
- **`['Praxial Self-Improving RAG (PSIR)'(-ing) BPMS]`**: The Skill Library *is* a RAG system for action.

#### **6.3. Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3):**

- **`['Praxial Agentic Crucible (PAC)'(-ing) BPMS]`**: Voyager is the "Crucible" where raw capability is refined into hardened skills.

#### **7. Rationale / Justification:**

The user asked for a "more fit/competent" implementation. NitroGen is "fit" for reaction, but Voyager is "fit" for *creation* and *complex problem solving*. Together, they form a complete **Neuro-Symbolic Architecture**.

#### **8. Scope of Application:**

Applies to complex tasks: building, crafting, puzzle-solving, and "Escape Room" logic where visual reflexes are insufficient.

#### The Protocol of Verifiable Skill Crystallization (ID: `VOYAGER-CORE-002`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Protocol) that implements `['Voyager'(-ing) BPMS]` as a generator of `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`. It defines a "fact" within the Fun Engine Framework not as static data, but as a **Verified Executable Skill**—code that has survived the selection pressure of runtime execution.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Protocol of Verifiable Skill Crystallization
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This protocol asserts that `truth is reproducible function`. It defines the "Atomic Fact" of the Voyager system as a "Skill"—a discrete unit of code (Python/GDScript) that, when executed in a specific context, reliably produces a specific outcome. If the code fails, it is noise; if it succeeds, it crystallizes into a Fact.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Verification]**

- **The Hypothesis (Code Generation):** The LLM (Abstract Logic) proposes a code snippet to solve a specific problem (e.g., "Mine Diamond" or "Move Node"). This is a probabilistic hypothesis.

- **The Experiment (Runtime Execution):** The code is injected into the `['Game Engine Testbed'(-ing) BPMS]` (Concrete Physics). The engine attempts to execute the logic against the physics of the simulation.

- The Crystallization (Success/Failure Signal):

  The environment returns a signal (Success/Error).

  - If **Error**: The hypothesis is rejected (Self-Correction triggered).
  - If **Success**: The code is "crystallized" and stored in the Skill Library. It transitions from "Attempt" to "Atomic Fact."

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [The Library of Praxis]**

The creation of a **Skill Library** that serves as the system's "DNA." Unlike a static database, this library grows organically. The system's "knowledge" is exactly equal to the set of actions it has successfully performed and verified.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To know is to do.* A fact is not a description of the world, but a proven method for changing it.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Verification):**

The "Physics" of truth is defined by the execution result:

- **If `[coding(-ing) BPMS]`: (Logic Physics)**

Fact(Skill)={True (Stored)False (Discarded)if Execute(Skill,Context)→Successif Execute(Skill,Context)→Error

The "Collapse" of the probability wave occurs when the interpreter returns a return code `0` (success) or `1` (error).

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Competence." The transition from "guessing" how to do something to "knowing" how to do it. The satisfaction of a tool that works every time.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation satisfies the requirement for `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` by grounding them in causality rather than text. A text description can be hallucinated; a working script that mines a diamond in a physics engine cannot be faked.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to all agentic behaviors, tool creation, API interactions, and procedural generation scripts within the framework.

#### The Axiom of Curriculum-Driven Ontology (ID: `VOYAGER-CORE-003`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that implements `['Voyager'(-ing) BPMS]` as a **`['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It establishes that the system's "existence" is defined by its **Automatic Curriculum**—the expanding frontier of what the system *attempts* to be.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Curriculum-Driven Ontology
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `existence is expansion`. The system does not exist in a steady state; it exists only insofar as it is pushing against the boundaries of its current capabilities. The **Automatic Curriculum** is the engine that generates "Desire" (Tasks), forcing the system to render new realities to satisfy those desires.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Becoming]**

- **The Frontier Assessment (The Horizon):** The system analyzes its current `Skill Library` and the state of the `['Game Engine Testbed'(-ing) BPMS]`. It identifies the "Zone of Proximal Development"—tasks that are possible but not yet achieved.
- **The Task Injection (The Demand):** The Curriculum Manager injects a new Task (e.g., "Build a Stone House"). This demand *forces* the system to engage with materials (Stone) and physics (Building) that were previously dormant.
- **The Ontological Rendering (The Realization):** By attempting the task, the agent forces the Game Engine to simulate specific interactions. The "Stone House" moves from a potential concept to a rendered reality in the Scene Tree.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Autotelic Evolution]**

The emergence of a system that grows without human intervention. The system becomes "Self-Teleological" (generating its own goals), ensuring that the `Fun Engine Framework` is an infinite game that plays itself to higher levels of complexity.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To be is to become.* Static existence is entropy; dynamic expansion is life. The system exists because it seeks to do more.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Expansion):**

The "Physics" of existence is driven by the maximization of the Exploration Metric:

- **If `[learning(-ing) BPMS]`: (Curriculum Physics)**

Existence(t+1)=Existence(t)+Δ(Novelty)

Where Δ(Novelty) is the set of new concepts/items/mechanics encountered during the execution of the new Task. `Next_Task = Maximize(Information_Gain(Potential_Tasks))`

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Curiosity." The drive to uncover the "Fog of War" in the map of capabilities. The intrinsic reward of discovering a new mechanic or crafting recipe.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implements the `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]` by ensuring the system is an *active* participant in its own creation. It aligns with `META-001` (Prime Directive of Evolution) by automating the evolutionary pressure.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to open-ended gameplay, scientific discovery simulations, and autonomous testing environments where the goal is to maximize coverage of the state space.

#### The Law of Symbiotic Code Injection (ID: `VOYAGER-CORE-004`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Law) that implements `['Voyager'(-ing) BPMS]` as the driver of **`['symbiosis evolution'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It defines how Voyager achieves symbiosis with other BPMS elements (like Godot or NitroGen) by injecting executable code into them.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Law of Symbiotic Code Injection
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This law asserts that `symbiosis is API mastery`. Voyager evolves not by growing its own "body," but by writing better "drivers" for other bodies. It acts as the **Universal Mind** that can inhabit any **Concrete Physics** engine (Godot, NitroGen) by dynamically generating the control logic (Code) that bridges the two.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Integration]**

- **The Interface Discovery (The Handshake):** Voyager reads the API/Documentation of the target BPMS (e.g., `['Godot Engine'(-ing) BPMS]` Class Reference). It "learns the language" of the host.
- **The Code Injection (The Possession):** Voyager generates a script (e.g., a `.gd` script or a Python API call) and injects it into the target system. It effectively "possesses" the target, turning a passive tool into an active agent.
- **The Symbiotic Loop (The Dance):** The target system executes the code and returns sensory data (Feedback). Voyager uses this feedback to optimize the code. The Mind (Voyager) gets a Body; the Body (Godot) gets a Brain.

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Polymorphic Agency]**

The ability of the `Fun Engine Framework` to reconfigure itself on the fly. The same "Mind" (Voyager) can drive a "Miner" (Minecraft/NitroGen) today and a "Spaceship" (Godot) tomorrow, simply by swapping the code injection library.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.* True power comes from the seamless integration of specialized holons (Mind + Body).

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Connection):**

The "Physics" of symbiosis is defined by the successful compilation and execution of the bridge code:

- **If `[integration(-ing) BPMS]`: (Interface Physics)**

Symbiosis=∫(VoyagerIntent×TargetAffordance)dt

The integration is successful when the `Intent` of Voyager maps 1:1 to the `Affordances` (capabilities) of the Target via the generated Code.

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "Extension." The feeling that the tool (Godot/NitroGen) has become part of its own body. The loss of distinction between "me" (the code) and "it" (the engine).

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implements `['symbiosis evolution'(-ing) BPMS]` by providing a concrete mechanism (Code Injection) for how different BPMS elements interact. It fulfills the user's request for Voyager to "implement for/achieve symbiosis with any elements."

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to cross-module integration, plugin systems, tool use, and the orchestration of heterogeneous AI models (e.g., LLM controlling a Diffusion Model).
