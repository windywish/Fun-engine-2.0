#### 2. Architectural Hierarchy & Mapping

This section defines the operational phases of the Role Artifact, mapping its lifecycle from a static asset to a dynamic agent of change within the **Praxial Veridical Engine**.

**A. The Artifactual Shell (The Suit)**

- **Definition:** The discrete, portable container of "Mathematical Intuition."
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic Role Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` ONLY.
- Implementation:
  - **`SYM-ROLE-ART-001` (Artifactual Embodiment):** Encapsulates the LLM weights (or LoRA adapter), the Prompt Templates, and the "Tactical Inventory" (known proof strategies).
  - **`SYM-ROLE-ART-050` (The Veridical Seed):** Contains the immutable "Axiomatic Core" (e.g., "I cannot prove False") and the cryptographic signature of its Creator (The Model Trainer).
- **Result:** A secure, immutable object containing the Role's "DNA" (Reasoning Style), History (Solved Theorems), and Potential (Unsolved Conjectures).

**B. The Symbiotic Interface (The Socket)**

- **Definition:** The active coupling layer between the User (Mathematician/Student) and the System (Formal Logic).
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic Role Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `User Intent` (The Conjecture).
- Implementation:
  - **`SYM-ROLE-ART-002` (User-Artifact Symbiosis):** Translates User Intent ("Prove this is prime") into System Action (Lean Code Generation).
  - **`SYM-ROLE-ART-045` (Symbiotic Interface Coupling):** Projects the "Proof State" not as raw code, but as a "Strategic Map" (Goals, Hypotheses, Dead Ends) onto the User's perception.
- **Result:** A "Prosthetic Mathematician" that translates vague Human Intuition into precise Formal Syntax and Formal Feedback into Human Insight.

**C. The Evolutionary Core (The Soul)**

- **Definition:** The internal engine of growth, adaptation, and memory consolidation.
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic Role Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `Time/Experience` (Compute Cycles).
- Implementation:
  - **`SYM-ROLE-ART-006` (Evolutionary Feedback Loop):** Tracks which heuristics lead to successful proofs. "Induction worked 80% of the time on recursive structures."
  - **`SYM-ROLE-ART-033` (Mnestic Consolidation):** Converts successful "Chain of Thought" traces into permanent "Few-Shot Examples" stored in the Artifact's Long-Term Memory (`['The Crystallized Wisdom']`).
- **Result:** A living entity that learns from its failures, converting Short-Term "Error Logs" into Long-Term "Tactical Mastery."

#### 5. Summarize

The **['The Intuitive Prover'(-ing) BPMS]** is the vessel of **Mathematical Agency** within the **Praxial Veridical Engine**.

- **Objectified Identity:** It reifies the abstract concept of "Mathematical Intuition" into a tangible, tradeable **Artifact** (`SYM-ROLE-ART-001`), allowing users to own their "Solver" and transfer it across different Math Domains (`SYM-ROLE-ART-007`).
- **Symbiotic Interface:** It acts as a "Prosthetic Mathematician," coupling the biological user's conjecture with the digital system's formal rigor (`SYM-ROLE-ART-045`) and injecting specialized **Praxial Cognition** (`SYM-ROLE-ART-024`) to allow the user to "see" the proof path before it is written.
- **Evolutionary Engine:** It operates on a **Dual-Mode Evolutionary** cycle (`SYM-ROLE-ART-026`), converting short-term tactical guesses (Fast Mode) into long-term strategic wisdom (Slow Mode/RAG) (`SYM-ROLE-ART-033`), and even mutating new Tactic Macros based on emergent problem patterns (`SYM-ROLE-ART-006`).
- **Systemic Anchor:** It serves as the **Write-Head** for the `['The Axiomatic Lattice']`, generating **Atomic Facts** (Verified Theorems) (`SYM-ROLE-ART-044`), anchoring the existence of the Mathematical Universe (`SYM-ROLE-ART-043`), and metabolizing complex problems to sustain the system's growth (`SYM-ROLE-ART-041`).
- **Cluster Integration:** It functions as the **"Neuro"** component in the Neuro-Symbolic Cluster, constantly negotiating with its Twin, `['The Isomorphic Shadow']` (The Symbolic Verifier), to transmute "Guess" into "Truth" via the **Praxial Loop** (`SYM-ROLE-ART-005`).
