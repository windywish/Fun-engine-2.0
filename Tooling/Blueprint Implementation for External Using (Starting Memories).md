# Blueprint: Implementation for External Using (Starting Memories)
- **ID:** `MEM-START-[User_Defined_ID]`
- **Name:** `['The Mnestic Weaver Seed'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Seed Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Mnestic Core']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['mnestic consolidation'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To establish the "Golden Chain" of continuity by injecting prior history and context before the simulation starts.
- **Scope of Application:** Cognitive Layer (The "Past" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#memory #history #context #golden-chain`

## 1. The Golden Chain (Key Events)
[List critical past events. e.g., "Event 1: Kael stole the chip from Arasaka. Event 2: Kael lost his arm in the escape."]

## 2. Relational Context
[Define past relationships. e.g., "Ally: Fixer Joe (Trust Level: High). Enemy: Agent Smith."]
