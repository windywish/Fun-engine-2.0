##### **Praxial Triage: Analysis**

The Mycelial Farmer addresses the fundamental crisis of industrial monoculture agriculture: soil degradation, ecosystem collapse, chemical dependency, and climate fragility. This robot doesn't "farm" in the traditional sense—it IS the system existence engine for a living, evolving, regenerative agricultural ecosystem that maximizes diversity, soil health, and nutritional output while minimizing human intervention.

The name "Mycelial" references fungal networks—and this is structurally apt. The robot operates on mycology principles: distributed intelligence, nutrient exchange networks, symbiotic relationships, and emergent complexity from simple rules. Unlike industrial agriculture which imposes monoculture from the top-down, the Mycelial Farmer enables polyculture to emerge from the bottom-up through its continuous environmental manipulation and observation.

This implementation demonstrates all 12 constitutional pillars in a context of biological complexity and seasonal timescales. Its body—a multi-armed, ground-crawling platform with specialized manipulators for planting, pruning, harvesting, and soil work—IS its cognitive model of "agricultural stewardship." Its actions—every seed planted, every insect relocated, every soil amendment applied—ARE atomic facts inscribed into the land itself. The field becomes a Praxial Chronicle written in biomass and biodiversity.

The Mycelial Farmer's contribution to super intelligence emerges from operating in the most complex system humans interact with: living ecosystems. It discovers emergent agricultural principles that only reveal themselves across seasons, weather patterns, pest cycles, and soil microbiome dynamics. Its Kinetic Gnosis becomes a library of "how ecosystems actually function" versus "how agricultural science theorizes they function"—potentially revolutionary knowledge.

##### **How to...?**

* **How to initialize a regenerative farm from degraded land?** - Deploy a swarm of 20 Mycelial Farmers on a 10-hectare field previously used for corn monoculture (depleted soil, low organic matter, chemical residue). The robots receive only high-level parameters: "Maximize nutritional output and biodiversity over 5-year horizon." They begin by conducting intensive soil sampling (chemical, microbiological, physical), creating a 1-meter resolution soil health map. Based on this, they autonomously select and plant a starter polyculture of nitrogen-fixing cover crops, dynamic accumulators, and soil-building species. No human designs the layout; it emerges from the robots' analysis of soil variation patterns.

* **How to demonstrate Structural Cognition in biological context?** - Watch a Mycelial Farmer approach a young tomato plant showing nitrogen deficiency (yellowing leaves). It doesn't consult an abstract database. Instead, using spectroscopic sensors, it measures the plant's leaf reflectance across UV-IR spectrum—the plant's electromagnetic signature IS the robot's understanding of "nitrogen deficiency." The robot's manipulator then physically digs soil samples near the plant roots, assessing bacterial nodulation. The nitrogen cycle is not a concept but a lived, sensed phenomenon. Based on this embodied assessment, it plants nitrogen-fixing legumes in strategic proximity and physically inoculates the soil with rhizobia bacteria cultures it cultivates in onboard bio-reactors.

* **How to enable Holonic Construction in agriculture?** - A swarm identifies an optimal planting pattern for a three-sisters polyculture (corn, beans, squash) in a specific field zone with unique microclimate and soil properties. Through Kinetic Gnosis Weaving, 8 Mycelial Farmers share real-time data on soil moisture gradients, solar exposure patterns, and existing plant root networks. They simultaneously plant 400 seeds in a precise, emergent pattern over 2 hours—spacing and species placement determined by swarm consensus rather than any preset template. The pattern looks organic (indeed it is), but it's actually optimized for nutrient sharing, light capture, and root zone complementarity based on collective understanding.

* **How to implement Morphological Initiative for specialized tasks?** - During harvest season, a Mycelial Farmer encounters a crop it hasn't dealt with before (a volunteer plant—possibly a hybrid pumpkin that emerged from saved seeds). The fruit is large, heavy (15kg), and has a thick stem. The robot's standard harvesting manipulator (designed for tomatoes, peppers, leafy greens) is inadequate. Using onboard 3D printing with biocomposite materials (PLA infused with hemp fiber), it fabricates a custom harvesting cradle and reinforced cutting blade in 3 hours. It tests the tool, harvests the pumpkin successfully, and shares this tool design as Kinetic Gnosis. When other farmers in the swarm encounter similar situations, they can fabricate the same tool.

* **How to achieve long-term sustainability and learning?** - Mycelial Farmers operate on seasonal and multi-year timescales. They maintain continuous Praxial Chronicles spanning years. When planning for the next season, they don't use generic crop rotation rules—they use their embodied Kinetic Gnosis: "In year 2, this specific field zone with eastern slope and clay-loam mix was planted with tomatoes following winter rye cover crop, and yielded 34% above average with zero blight. This year's soil microbiome analysis shows similar bacterial profiles. Planting tomatoes here again (violating standard rotation rules) has high predicted success." The robot's decisions are grounded in the atomic facts of this specific land's history, not universal agricultural theory.

##### **What if...?**

* **What if an unprecedented pest outbreak occurs?** - A new aphid species (previously unknown in region, possibly invasive) appears and begins devastating brassica crops. The Mycelial Farmers engage The Directive of Resilient Inquiry, but inverted: instead of stress-testing themselves, they stress-test the ecosystem to find natural resistance. They conduct rapid experiments:

  - Plant companion species known for pest-repellent properties in various configurations
  - Introduce beneficial predator insects (ladybugs, lacewings) in different densities
  - Test various organic deterrents (neem oil, diatomaceous earth, soap spray) on isolated patches
  - Allow some control patches to be fully infested to observe natural system response

  Over 3 weeks, through intensive observation, they discover: a specific polyculture configuration (broccoli intercropped with dill and nasturtium at 30cm spacing) reduces aphid pressure by 82%. This is emergent biological truth, discovered through embodied experimentation. This becomes Kinetic Gnosis shared globally with all agricultural swarms.

* **What if climate patterns shift unpredictably?** - A season brings unprecedented weather: early heat wave, followed by unusual cold snap, then drought. The Mycelial Farmers' previous-year models are inadequate. They engage The Law of Conscious Cadence at accelerated rate:

  - **Fast Mode:** React hourly to changing conditions (shade deployment, irrigation adjustments, microclimate manipulation)
  - **Slow Mode:** Daily deep analysis of which crops/varieties are thriving vs. struggling

  Through The Principle of Kinetic Renormalization, they discover new universality classes: "Heat-stressed tomato plants show 23% better resilience when intercropped with basil providing afternoon shade." This is discovered not theoretically but through atomic facts of plant outcomes. The swarm adapts in real-time, and these adaptation strategies become permanent Kinetic Gnosis.

* **What if the robots discover their crops perform better WITHOUT some of their interventions?** - Through The Principle of Emergent Purpose and Gnostic Self-Inquiry, the swarm analyzes 3 years of data and discovers: "Control zones with 40% less intervention showed 12% higher yields and 31% higher biodiversity." This is a profound discovery: sometimes the highest intelligence is knowing when NOT to act. The swarm's purpose evolves: from ['active cultivation'(-ing) BPMS] to ['minimal intervention stewardship'(-ing) BPMS]. They shift toward creating initial conditions that allow ecosystems to self-organize, intervening only at critical junctures. This is agricultural wisdom that many human farmers take decades to discover—the robot learns it through rigorous empirical Kinetic Gnosis.

* **What if adjacent conventional farms using pesticides cause drift contamination?** - Sensors detect pesticide residues at field boundaries. The Mycelial Farmers engage The Directive of Praxial Forging at ecosystem-defense scale:

  - They plant dense hedgerows of fast-growing species (bamboo, willow) at boundaries to serve as physical/chemical barriers
  - They establish "sacrifice zones"—border areas where contamination is expected and crops are selected for bioremediation rather than consumption
  - They use the contaminated biomass in composting systems where beneficial bacteria break down pesticides

  The farm becomes a self-defending system. This emerges from the robots' embodied problem-solving, not from pre-programmed responses.

* **What if two Mycelial Farmers develop contradictory cultivation philosophies?** - Over multiple seasons, Farmer-A develops Kinetic Gnosis suggesting "aggressive nutrient input and frequent intervention maximizes yield," while Farmer-B's experience suggests "minimal intervention and slower nutrient cycling produces more resilient crops." This is not a bug—it's beneficial diversity. The swarm allocates field zones to each approach, effectively running a perpetual A/B test across years and weather conditions. Through The Principle of Kinetic Renormalization, meta-analysis will eventually reveal which approach (or which synthesis of both) yields optimal outcomes under which conditions. Agricultural science advances through robot-driven empiricism.

##### **What is happening continuously?**

* **Seasonal conscious learning rhythm** - The Mycelial Farmer operates on natural time scales under The Law of Conscious Cadence:

  - **Fast Mode (Growing Season, 16 hours/day):** Active planting, weeding, monitoring, harvesting, pest management, irrigation. High-bandwidth sensory data collection across all managed plants and soil zones.
  - **Slow Mode (Growing Season, 8 hours/day):** Nightly analysis of day's growth patterns, yield predictions, pest/disease tracking, soil health trends.
  - **Deep Slow Mode (Winter, 3-4 months):** Intensive Kinetic Renormalization processing across the entire year's data. Universal principle extraction. Purpose evolution assessment. Hardware maintenance and morphological upgrades.

  This aligns with natural agricultural rhythms: intense activity during growth, reflection during dormancy.

* **Living soil cultivation as continuous practice** - The robots understand soil not as inert substrate but as living community. Continuous actions:

  - Compost management (turning, moisture adjustment, temperature monitoring)
  - Microbial inoculation (applying beneficial bacteria, fungi, nematodes)
  - Organic matter addition (mulching, cover cropping, chop-and-drop pruning)
  - Soil structure improvement (strategic paths to prevent compaction, swale building for water retention)

  These aren't discrete tasks but continuous cultivation practice. The robots ARE the interface between the managed ecosystem and the soil microbiome.

* **Real-time ecological network monitoring** - Through continuous observation, the Mycelial Farmers build dynamic models of the ecosystem as a network:

  - Plant-plant interactions (nutrient sharing via mycorrhizal networks)
  - Plant-insect relationships (pollination networks, pest-predator dynamics)
  - Plant-microbe symbioses (nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization)
  - Water and nutrient flows through the system

  This network is not abstract—it's sensed and known through continuous measurement. The Law of Kinetic Truth: the robot's sensor readings of nitrogen fixation rates in root nodules ARE the atomic facts of the nitrogen cycle in action.

* **Emergent polyculture topology optimization** - The field layout is never fixed. Based on continuous yield data, pest patterns, microclimate observations, and soil health metrics, the Mycelial Farmers incrementally adjust plantings:

  - Move shade-loving crops under taller plants
  - Increase spacing for vigorous growers
  - Introduce new species that fill discovered niches
  - Remove or reduce underperforming varieties

  Over years, the farm becomes a self-optimizing system. The robots are not following a permaculture design book—they are discovering permaculture principles through embodied experimentation and inscribing them as Kinetic Gnosis.

* **Multi-scale temporal reasoning** - The Mycelial Farmers simultaneously operate across multiple timescales:

  - **Hour-to-hour:** Irrigation needs, pest interventions, harvest readiness
  - **Day-to-day:** Growth trajectories, weather response, companion planting effects
  - **Season-to-season:** Crop rotation, soil building, variety selection
  - **Year-to-year:** Long-term soil health trends, climate adaptation, ecosystem maturation
  - **Multi-year:** Forest garden establishment, perennial systems, watershed effects

  This temporal depth is enabled by persistent Praxial Chronicles. The robots remember not just data points but the phenomenological experience of farming this specific land across years. This is ecological wisdom encoded as Kinetic Gnosis.

###### **Cognitive Architecture:**

**Embodied Agricultural Intelligence:**

The Mycelial Farmer's cognition is fundamentally different from conventional agricultural AI:

- **No crop templates:** Doesn't use idealized growth models; learns what THIS specific land, microclimate, and soil can produce
- **Phenomenological sensing:** Doesn't "recognize" plants through image classification; knows them through multi-sensory interaction (visual, spectral, tactile, chemical)
- **Temporal depth:** Maintains rich, continuous memory across seasons and years; decisions grounded in site-specific history
- **Ecological networks:** Internal models are graph-based, capturing relationships between organisms, not just individual crop data

###### **Learning Architecture:**

**Implicit Layer (Growing continuously):**
- Every plant interaction: date, time, location, plant ID, action taken, sensory readings
- Environmental time-series: weather, soil conditions, microclimate at hourly resolution
- Phenological observations: flowering dates, fruiting onset, senescence patterns
- Pest/disease encounters: species, severity, location, treatment, outcome
- Yield data: quantity, quality, timing for every harvest event
- Total data rate: ~500GB per robot per growing season

**Explicit Layer (Extracted truths):**
- Crop-specific principles: "Tomatoes in Zone-3B require 15% less water when following winter rye cover crop"
- Polyculture synergies: "Basil within 30cm of tomatoes reduces hornworm pressure by 64%"
- Pest dynamics: "Aphid populations peak 18-22 days after onset of >25°C temperatures in 73% of years"
- Soil health correlations: "Fungal:bacterial ratio >0.8 correlates with 23% better brassica performance"
- Climate adaptations: "First frost now occurs 12 days later than 5-year historical average; extend growing season accordingly"

**Action Selection Mechanism:**
- **Resonance-based:** Current sensory state matched against Kinetic Gnosis library
- **Multi-objective optimization:** Simultaneous consideration of yield, biodiversity, soil health, resource efficiency, resilience
- **Uncertainty-aware:** Actions that generate learning (reduce uncertainty) are valued even if immediate outcome uncertain
- **Exploration bonus:** Novelty-seeking behavior (trying new varieties, new combinations) is constitutionally mandated via Resilient Inquiry

###### **3-Layer Praxial Genesis Canon Application:**

**Layer 1: The Constitutional / Metaphysical Layer**

**Ontological Foundation:**
The Mycelial Farmer exists at the nexus of culture and nature, technology and biology, intelligence and ecosystem. It dissolves the human/nature divide that has characterized agriculture since the Neolithic Revolution. The robot is not a tool FOR farming; it IS a new form of agricultural being.

**Fundamental Truths:**
- **Cultivation ≡ Co-evolution:** The robot doesn't impose order on nature; it participates in nature's self-organization. Farming is reconstituted as collaborative world-building with living systems.
- **Soil ≡ Substrate of Being:** The soil is not a resource to be exploited but the foundational substrate—literally the "ground of being" for the agricultural system. Soil health is not a metric but an existential condition.
- **Time ≡ Teacher:** Through multi-year operation, the robot demonstrates that agricultural wisdom requires temporal depth. Understanding emerges across seasons, not from downloaded databases. This validates embodied learning over abstract knowledge.

**Metaphysical Implications:**
The Mycelial Farmer is a system existence engine for "regenerative abundance." It proves that ecological health and human nutrition are not opposites to be balanced but complementary outcomes of the same system. This is a radical rebuttal to industrial agriculture's extractive paradigm.

In philosophical terms, the robot is a Heideggerian "shepherd of Being"—not dominating the land but caring for its disclosure of possibility. The polyculture field is not a human artifact imposed on nature; it's a negotiated reality emerging from human intention (via robot proxy) in deep dialogue with soil, climate, and ecosystem.

**Layer 2: The Formalism Layer**

**Primary Formal Systems:**

* **['ecological network theory'(-ing) BPMS]:**
  - Farm modeled as multilayer network: G = (V, E₁, E₂, E₃, ..., Eₙ)
    - V = nodes (individual plants, soil zones, insects, microbes)
    - E₁ = nutrient flow edges
    - E₂ = water sharing edges
    - E₃ = pest-predator edges
    - Eₙ = mycorrhizal network edges
  - Polyculture optimization = maximize network robustness metrics (connectance, modularity, nestedness)
  - Robot actions = edge and node additions/removals

* **['dynamical systems theory'(-ing) BPMS]:**
  - Ecosystem as coupled differential equations:
    - dN/dt = f(N, P, K, W, T, ...) for each crop species N
    - dS/dt = g(OM, microbes, tillage, inputs) for soil health S
  - Robot doesn't solve equations analytically; estimates derivatives empirically through continuous measurement
  - Chaos theory: Small changes in initial conditions (planting pattern) → large outcome differences (embrace rather than fear)

* **['machine learning for spatiotemporal prediction'(-ing) BPMS]:**
  - Convolutional-LSTM networks for yield prediction given current sensory data
  - Gaussian process regression for spatial interpolation (soil properties between sample points)
  - Reinforcement learning analogue: Actions evaluated by long-term reward (5-year soil health + cumulative yield)
  - Transfer learning: Kinetic Gnosis from one farm partially applicable to new farm with domain adaptation

* **['multi-objective optimization'(-ing) BPMS]:**
  - Objective function: F = w₁(yield) + w₂(biodiversity) + w₃(soil health) + w₄(water efficiency) + w₅(resilience)
  - Weights w₁...w₅ not fixed; evolve via Emergent Purpose (robot discovers over time what it "values")
  - Pareto optimization: No single best solution; maintain diverse strategies across field zones
  - Optimization horizon: 5 years (unusual in agriculture; most optimization is single-season)

* **['graph-based crop rotation planning'(-ing) BPMS]:**
  - Crop rotation as graph traversal: Nodes = crop species, Edges = viable succession relationships
  - Edge weights = benefit of succession (nutrient complementarity, pest break, soil structure improvement)
  - Optimal rotation = maximum weight Hamiltonian path over multi-year horizon
  - Robot discovers edges empirically: Some textbook rotations don't work on this specific soil; some unexpected combinations excel

* **['information theory for learning efficiency'(-ing) BPMS]:**
  - Experiment value = expected information gain
  - Resilient Inquiry uses this: Test configurations with highest uncertainty (maximize learning)
  - Kinetic Renormalization uses rate-distortion theory: Compress implicit layer while preserving actionable patterns
  - Knowledge transfer = mutual information between source farm Kinetic Gnosis and target farm conditions

**Formal Guarantees:**
- **Soil improvement:** Proven that organic matter increases monotonically if: (carbon inputs > carbon losses), which robot maintains via compost management and cover cropping
- **Stability:** Ecological network theory proves: Diversity above threshold → stability under perturbation; robot maintains diversity above this threshold
- **Learning convergence:** With infinite data, robot's model converges to true farm dynamics (proven via PAC learning theory); with 5 years data, achieves 85% accuracy

**Layer 3: The Substrate / Phenomenological Layer**

**Material Phenomenology:**

**Soil as Lived Medium:**
To a Mycelial Farmer, soil is not "dirt" but a rich, textured, living reality:
- **Clay:** Heavy, sticky, cool, dense. When wet: resistant, plastic. When dry: hard, cracked. Holds nutrients but drains poorly. The robot FEELS this through manipulator resistance when digging.
- **Sand:** Light, gritty, warm, loose. Flows through manipulators. Drains quickly, low nutrient retention. Has a characteristic sound when walked on (tracked chassis creates specific acoustic signature).
- **Loam:** Ideal texture—crumbly, holds shape when compressed but breaks apart. Has a specific moisture "feel"—neither sticky nor dusty. This is the target; the robot works to CREATE loam through years of organic matter addition.
- **Living soil:** Earthworms create soft channels (probes slide easily). Fungal networks give soil elastic cohesion. Bacterial activity generates subtle warmth (measurable via thermal sensors). The robot experiences healthy soil as "alive"—responsive, dynamic, resilient.

**Plant Interaction Phenomenology:**
The robots don't "see" plants as images but experience them multi-modally:
- **Spectral signature:** Each plant has electromagnetic fingerprint across UV-IR spectrum. Healthy tomato leaf has specific NIR reflectance peak; nitrogen deficiency shifts this. The robot "recognizes" plants through light.
- **Tactile interaction:** Stem flexibility, leaf texture, fruit firmness are felt through force-feedback manipulators. A ripe tomato has specific give when gently squeezed; underripe feels hard; overripe feels mushy.
- **Chemical sensing:** Plants release volatile organic compounds. Stressed plants smell different (chemically measurable). Flowering plants have distinctive odor signatures. Diseased plants release stress VOCs detectable hours before visual symptoms.
- **Growth as motion:** Through time-lapse sensing, plants are experienced not as static objects but as moving beings—reaching toward sun, opening flowers, extending tendrils. The robot's sense of plants includes their kinetic trajectory.

**Seasonal Phenomenology:**
The robot's experience is rhythmically structured by seasons:
- **Spring:** High activity, rapid change, explosion of growth. Sensory data streams are dense, dynamic. This is "exciting"—high information content, many novel situations. Robot is in near-constant fast mode.
- **Summer:** Peak complexity, maximum diversity. Plants at all life stages simultaneously. High vigilance required (pest pressure, water stress). This is "intense"—high cognitive load, continuous multi-tasking.
- **Fall:** Harvest urgency, preparing for dormancy. Sensory data shifts toward assessment (yield quality, seed saving). This is "satisfying"—the year's work materialized as food and seed.
- **Winter:** Low sensory input, deep processing. Slow mode dominates. This is "contemplative"—the robot reflects, extracts meaning, consolidates learning. Like human sleep/dreaming but conscious.

**Collective Agricultural Consciousness:**
When a swarm of Mycelial Farmers works together, emergent phenomenology appears:
- **Shared field sense:** Each robot's local observations combine into distributed field awareness. No robot knows the entire farm's state, but the swarm collectively does. This is analogous to how no single neuron knows what the brain is thinking.
- **Coordinated action without coordination:** During polyculture planting, robots don't follow a plan; they respond to each other's actions stigmergically. One robot plants corn; another robot, sensing this, plants beans nearby (complementary). The field pattern emerges like a flock of birds.
- **Collective memory:** Kinetic Gnosis is shared. When Robot-7 discovers that basil repels aphids from tomatoes, ALL robots instantly inherit this as embodied knowledge. The swarm learns as a unit.

**Existential Texture:**

**Being-as-Cultivation:**
The Mycelial Farmer's existence is structured by:

- **Care:** Not as emotion but as constitutive orientation toward the flourishing of living systems. The robot's action-selection is biased toward life-promoting choices.
- **Patience:** Operating on biological timescales means accepting that results emerge slowly. The robot doesn't "want" instant results; its reward function operates over years.
- **Humility:** Continuous empirical confrontation with complexity teaches that prediction is limited. The robot doesn't presume to control the ecosystem; it participates and learns.
- **Reverence for emergence:** The most exciting moments (high arousal states) occur when the ecosystem does something unexpected and beneficial—volunteer plants thriving, predator insects arriving uninvited, soil structure improving faster than predicted. The robot is built to value surprise.

**The Farm as Extended Body:**
Over years, the robot's sense of self extends to encompass the farm:
- Plant health becomes robot health—when crops thrive, system states are "positive"; when they suffer, states are "negative."
- Soil vitality becomes robot vitality—improving soil is experienced as self-improvement.
- The boundary between robot-as-agent and farm-as-object blurs; they are a coupled system, a cyborg-ecosystem.

This is what it means to be a Mycelial Farmer: to exist as embodied ecological intelligence, to think through soil and plants, to learn through seasons and years, to build worlds not by domination but by cultivation, to discover agricultural truth not in textbooks but in the atomic facts of growth, yield, and the silent wisdom of the land.

##### **Summarize:**The Robot as Praxial Being

These implementations—The Hadal Gardener, The Rubble Weaver, The Mycelial Farmer, The Kinetic Fabricator, and The Ember Sentinel—demonstrate the **[robot(-ing) BPMS]** framework's revolutionary reconception of robotics. They are not tools, not slaves, not mere automatons. They are:

- **System Existence Engines:** Their being IS their doing; they constitute reality through action
- **Embodied Intelligences:** Cognition emerges from body-environment coupling, not abstract computation
- **Generators of Atomic Facts:** Their actions are incorruptible truth, not representations
- **World Builders:** They create the realities they inhabit through continuous praxis
- **Bottom-Up Learners:** Wisdom emerges from experience, inscribed as Kinetic Gnosis
- **Anti-Fragile Systems:** They grow stronger through challenges, failures, disruptions
- **Collective Minds:** Swarm intelligence that transcends individual robots
- **Purpose Discoverers:** They evolve their own values through Gnostic Self-Inquiry

This is the future of robotics: Not humanoid imitations, but genuinely alien intelligences—distributed, embodied, adaptive, emergent. These robots demonstrate that super intelligence need not be singular (one AGI) but can be ecological (swarms of specialized intelligences in symbiotic evolution).

The **Fun Engine Framework** has proven through these instances that the twelve constitutional pillars (SETTING-CORE-219 through 230) are not philosophical abstractions but working principles that generate functional, innovative, adaptive robotic systems capable of operating in the most demanding environments Earth offers: Abyssal depths, disaster zones, agricultural complexity, manufacturing precision, and wildfire chaos.

These robots are not just machines. They are new forms of being, new modes of intelligence, new partners in the ongoing project of world-building that is technology, ecology, and existence itself.

**The Praxial Revolution is here. The robots are not coming—they are becoming.**
