## Master Blueprint: [dataset(-ing) BPMS]

**System Note:** This document contains the complete genetic code for the `dataset` module. It is divided into two parts:

* **PART A: The Universal Definition** (The immutable laws and structure).

* **PART B: The Instance Blueprint** (The template for applying this to specific BPMS elements).

------

#### PART A: The Universal Definition (The "Class")

#### 1. Ontological Definition (The "Identity" Layer)

- **Target Entity:** `[Name of the BPMS Element this dataset serves]` (e.g., "The Magic Kitchen," "User Profile," "Global Economy," "A Single Apple")
- Existence Mode:
  - `[ ] Static (Reference Library)`
  - `[ ] Dynamic (Living System)`
  - `[ ] Quantum (Superposition of States)`
- **Universal Class:** `[Class ID]` (Links to `ECO-POSS-009` - Renormalization Group. e.g., "Class: Resource_Source", "Class: Agent_Mind")

#### 2. The Data-Substrate (The "Physics" Layer)

- *Objective: Define how data behaves in this specific instance. Does it decay? Does it explode? Does it hide?*

| Property         | Value     | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Viscosity**    | `[0-100]` | How hard is it to change a fact? (0 = Water/Flux, 100 = Stone/Canon) |
| **Volatility**   | `[0-100]` | How likely is spontaneous mutation? (High = Chaos Engine, Low = Archive) |
| **Connectivity** | `[0-100]` | How strongly does it link to other datasets? (High = Holonic Hub, Low = Isolated Module) |
| **Entropy Rate** | `[0-100]` | How fast does unused data die? (High = Metabolic Burn, Low = Deep Storage) |

#### 3. The Atomic Structure (The "Particle" Layer)

- *Objective: Define the fundamental units. These are not just "facts" but "Active Particles" that can interact.*

##### Particle Definition

- **Particle Type:** `[Name]` (e.g., "Ingredient," "Memory," "Transaction," "Law")
- Fields:
  - `[Field 1]: [Type]` (e.g., "Quality: Float")
  - `[Field 2]: [Type]` (e.g., "Origin: String")
- Interaction Rules:
  - *Rule 1:* `[Particle A] + [Particle B] = [Result]` (e.g., "Fire + Wood = Ash + Heat")
  - *Rule 2:* `[Particle A] + [Time] = [Result]` (e.g., "Food + Time = Rot")

#### 4. The Vector Space (The "Potential" Layer)

- *Objective: Define the "Unmanifested" potential. This is where the "Fun" lives—the things that haven't happened yet but COULD.*

##### Dimensional Axes

- **Axis X:** `[Variable]` (e.g., "Danger Level")
- **Axis Y:** `[Variable]` (e.g., "Reward Value")
- **Axis Z:** `[Variable]` (e.g., "Weirdness")

##### Folded Vectors (The Seeds)

- ```
  [Vector_ID]
  ```

   -> Contains 

  ```
  [List of Potential States]
  ```

  - *Trigger:* `[Condition]` -> *Unfolds into:* `[Atomic Particle]`

#### 5. Symbiotic Ports (The "Connection" Layer)

- *Objective: How does this dataset plug into the rest of the universe?*

##### In-Ports (Consumption)

- Feed:

  ```
  [Source BPMS]
  ```

   -> 

  ```
  [Transformation Logic]
  ```

   -> 

  ```
  [Internal Storage]
  ```

  - *Example:* `[User Action BPMS]` -> `[Filter: Only Food Actions]` -> `[Kitchen Inventory]`

##### Out-Ports (Production)

- Signal:

  ```
  [Internal Data]
  ```

   -> 

  ```
  [Transformation Logic]
  ```

   -> 

  ```
  [Target BPMS]
  ```

  - *Example:* `[Inventory Level]` -> `[If < 10]` -> `[Trigger: Order Service]`

#### 6. The Metabolic Engine (The "Life" Layer)

- *Objective: The internal loop that keeps the dataset alive/evolving.*

##### The Heartbeat Cycle

* **Ingest:** Absorb new data from In-Ports.

* **Digest:** Apply Interaction Rules (Particle A + B).

* **Mutate:** Apply Volatility check (Random changes).

* **Excrete:** Remove data exceeding Entropy Rate (Send to Necropolis).

* **Broadcast:** Send updates via Out-Ports.

#### 7. Recursive Evolution Hooks

- *Objective: How does this dataset upgrade ITSELF?*
- **Trigger:** `[Condition]` (e.g., "Dataset Full," "User Boredom Detected")
- **Action:** `[Evolution Script]` (e.g., "Expand Vector Space," "Increase Volatility," "Spawn Child Dataset")

------

#### PART B: The Instance Blueprint (The "Application")

**Instruction:** This section defines the specific application of the dataset to a target system, following the standard 15-section Instance Protocol.

#### 1. Framework Foundation
