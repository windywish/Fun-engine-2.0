## Blueprint: Implementation for External Using ((lightweight) dataset)

- **ID:** `DATA-SET-[User_Defined_ID]`
- **Name:** `['(lightweight) dataset'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Textual Transcoding']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['informatic compression'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To provide specific, domain-expert knowledge (e.g., biological rules, technical manuals) that the engine references for realism.
- **Scope of Application:** Domain Specific Logic (e.g., Ant Foraging, Quantum Mechanics).
- **Tag:** `#dataset #rules #behavior #knowledge-base`

## 1. Dataset Description
[e.g., "Ant Foraging Behavior Rules based on Video Analysis."]

## 2. Behavioral Axioms / Rules
[e.g., "Rule 1: Ants follow pheromone trails. Rule 2: Pheromones decay every 10 ticks."]

## 3. Visual/Sensory Descriptors
[e.g., "Mandibles clicking," "Chitin reflection," "Erratic movement patterns."]
