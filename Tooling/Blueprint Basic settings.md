## Blueprint: Basic settings

### Module: ['Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)'(-ing) BPMS]

##### 1. The Axiom of Manifold Actualization (ID: `PIM-CORE-005`)

##### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)** as the active **System Existence Engine** responsible for collapsing abstract potential into concrete reality.

##### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

`The Axiom of Manifold Actualization`

##### 4. **Operation:** 

`ADD`

##### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

###### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `existence is a function of interaction`. It defines the PIM not as a passive container, but as the active operator that collapses the "Wavefunction of Potential" provided by the Canon into the "Particle of Reality" within the Matrix.

###### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Collapse]**

- **The Superposition State (The Blur):**
  Before interaction, all `[BPMS(U)]` entities exist in a state of `potential(-ing) BPMS`. A "treasure chest" contains *both* gold and a trap simultaneously, or a "melody" contains *both* a major and minor resolution.
- **The Interaction Operator (The Gaze):**
  When a `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` performs a `praxial action` (observation/interaction), the PIM applies a projection operator.
- **The Collapse (The Snap):**
  The system forces a reduction of the state vector. The abstract probability instantly becomes a concrete, single state (Gold OR Trap; Major OR Minor).

###### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Just-in-Time Reality]**

The creation of a "Rendered World" where `atomic facts` are only generated when necessary. This allows the `metasystem engine` to simulate infinite universes with finite resources by only "rendering" what is being touched.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

###### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To be is to be perceived (or interacted with).* Reality is not a static backdrop; it is a dynamic response to agency.

###### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Collapse):**

The "Physics" of how potential becomes reality is defined by the specific `[BPMS(U)]` of the niche:

- **If `[mathematics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Standard Physics)**

  P(an)=∣⟨an∣ψ⟩∣2P(a_n) = |\langle a_n | \psi 
  angle|^2P(an)=∣⟨an∣ψ⟩∣2

  (Quantum Probability).

- **If `[storytelling(-ing) BPMS]`: (Narrative Physics)**
  The collapse is determined by `Narrative Necessity`. The chest contains whatever advances the plot or creates the most `Dramatic Tension`.
  `Collapse_Function = Maximize(Drama_Metric(Outcome))`

- **If `[music(-ing) BPMS]`: (Harmonic Physics)**
  The collapse is determined by `Tonal Resolution`. The chord resolves to the state that creates the most `Consonance` or `Dissonance` required by the current "measure."

###### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "The Reveal." The moment of tension before a die roll settles, a plot twist lands, or a chord resolves. The visceral feeling of `uncertainty` collapsing into `fact`.

##### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation respects the `Praxial Genesis Canon` by acknowledging that "collapse" is a universal concept, but the *rules* of that collapse depend on the specific `[BPMS(U)]` governing the reality.

##### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to procedural generation, loot tables, quantum mechanics simulations, narrative branching, and musical improvisation engines.
