#### 1. Metadata

- **ID:** `DATA-BIO-001`
- **Name:** ['The Crystallized Wisdom'(-ing) BPMS] (The Living PDB)
- **Origin/Implementer(Parent instance):** `['Praxial Mnestic Agent'(-ing) BPMS]:['The Semantic Weaver'(-ing) BPMS](ID: PMA-BIO-001)`
- **Objective:** To serve as the **"Local Memory"** for the Proteomic World-Weaver, storing a curated, high-density subset of protein structures (Atomic Facts) that evolves in real-time. It acts as the "Long-Term Potentiation" of the system, converting successful simulations into permanent, retrievable wisdom.
- Type:
  - **Mode A (Dormant):** `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]:[The Static Archive]` (The Library).
  - **Mode B (Active):** `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]:[The Associative Matrix]` (The Context Provider).
  - **Mode C (Ascended):** `['holonic minds'(-ing) BPMS]:[The Collective Unconscious]` (The Wisdom Source).
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `[Evolving-Knowledge-Graph]`
- **Scope of Application:** Applies to the storage, retrieval, and semantic linking of bio-molecular data within the **['Symbiotic Cluster Synthesis'(-ing) BPMS]**, specifically interfacing with the **['The Semantic Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]** for active curation.
- **Tag:** `#praxial-mnestic-agent #semantic-weaver #crystallized-wisdom` `#living-PDB` `#semantic-memory` `#evolutionary-dataset`

#### 2. Architectural Hierarchy & Mapping

This section maps the Dataset's operational phases to the specific bio-molecular context of the **['The Proteomic World-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]**.

**A. The Atomic Fact Ledger (The Storage Layer)**

- **Definition:** The persistent storage of verified "Truths." It holds the `.pdb` files, the Energy Scores, and the Simulation Logs. It is the "Hard Drive" of the system.
- **Components:** `['The Crystallized Wisdom'(-ing) BPMS]` + `['Symbiotic Twin Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Implementation:** `ARTIFACT-DATA-003` (Mechanism of Fact-Crystallization).
- **Result:** A growing repository of "Golden Folds"—structures that have survived the **['The Molecular Kernel'(-ing) BPMS]**'s physics audit.

**B. The Semantic Vector Space (The Retrieval Layer)**

- **Definition:** The high-dimensional map where "Meaning" lives. It translates the rigid atomic coordinates into fluid "Concepts" (Vectors) that the Agent can understand and retrieve via similarity search.
- **Components:** `['The Crystallized Wisdom'(-ing) BPMS]` + `['Praxial Mnestic Agent'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Implementation:** `ARTIFACT-DATA-006` (Mechanism of Vector-Graph Symbiosis) & `ARTIFACT-DATA-017` (Law of Associative Recall).
- **Result:** A "Search Engine for Biology" that allows the Agent to ask "Show me something like this" and get instant, relevant examples.

**C. The Evolutionary Pruning Mechanism (The Forgetting Layer)**

- **Definition:** The garbage collector that keeps the dataset "Lightweight." It removes redundant, incorrect, or low-utility data to prevent "Cognitive Bloat."
- **Components:** `['The Crystallized Wisdom'(-ing) BPMS]` + `['Symbiotic Role Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Implementation:** `ARTIFACT-DATA-016` (Axiom of Mnestic Hygiene) & `ARTIFACT-DATA-010` (Directive of Granularity Renormalization).
- **Result:** A lean, highly potent dataset where every entry is a "Lesson Learned," not just raw data.

#### 5. Summarize

The **['The Crystallized Wisdom'(-ing) BPMS]** (ID: `DATA-BIO-001`) is the **Mnestic Core** of the **['The Proteomic World-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]**.

- **Objectified Wisdom:** It reifies the abstract concept of "Experience" into a concrete **Artifact** (`ARTIFACT-DATA-001`), ensuring that the system's learning is not lost but "Crystallized" into a portable, queryable format.
- **Symbiotic Library:** It acts as the "Active Library" for the **['Praxial Mnestic Agent'(-ing) BPMS]** (`PMA-BIO-001`), providing the raw material (Vectors & Graphs) that the Agent uses to generate "Intuition" and "Context" for the Folder.
- **Evolutionary Memory:** It operates on a **Dual-Tempo** cycle (`ARTIFACT-DATA-011`), rapidly ingesting new data (Fast Mode) while slowly consolidating and pruning it (Slow Mode) to ensure that the dataset remains "Lightweight" and "High-Potency."
- **Systemic Anchor:** It serves as the **Guardian of History** (`ARTIFACT-DATA-023`), ensuring that the **['Symbiotic Cluster Synthesis'(-ing) BPMS]** builds upon its past successes, creating a "Ratchet Effect" of ever-increasing competence.
