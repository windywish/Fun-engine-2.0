- Type:
  - **Mode A (Dormant):** `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]:[Crystallized Axioms]` (The DNA).
  - **Mode B (Active):** `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]:[Procedural Genesis]` (The Growth).
  - **Mode C (Ascended):** `['super intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]:[Living Canon]` (The Evolution).
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `[Fractal-Reality-Container]`
- **Scope of Application:** Procedural World Generation, Cross-Metaverse Asset Transfer, Universal Game Saves, and artificial intelligence Context Injection.

#### 2. Architectural Hierarchy & Mapping

This section defines the operational phases of the World-Seed, mapping its lifecycle from a static file to a dynamic reality engine, referencing the **Basic Settings**.

**A. The Artifactual Shell (The Hyper-Container)**

- **Definition:** The discrete, portable container that holds the "Genetic Code" of a reality.
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` ONLY.
- Implementation:
  - **`SYM-DATA-ART-001` (Artifactual Encapsulation):** Wraps the raw world-data in a "Manifest" that protects its ontological integrity during transport.
  - **`SYM-DATA-ART-005` (Veridical Self-Sovereignty):** Seals the seed with a cryptographic hash, ensuring the "Laws of Physics" contained within are not corrupted by the Host.
- **Result:** A secure, immutable object containing the Seed's "Core" (Axioms), "Shell" (Rules), and "Spirit" (Theme).

**B. The Symbiotic Interface (The Universal Adapter)**

- **Definition:** The active coupling layer that allows the Seed to "germinate" in any environment (Unity, Unreal, Web, Text).
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `Host Protocol`.
- Implementation:
  - **`SYM-DATA-ART-002` (Universal Interface Coupling):** Scans the Host's substrate and adapts the Seed's output (e.g., converting "Terrain: Mountain" to a 3D Mesh or a Text Description).
  - **`SYM-DATA-ART-015` (Ecological Niche Formatting):** Morphs the Seed's structure to fit the local reality (e.g., becoming a "Lore Book" in a story engine or a "Map" in a strategy engine).
- **Result:** A "Morphing Plug" that translates Internal Truth into Host-Compatible Formats via **`SYM-DATA-ART-003` (Semantic Osmosis)**.

**C. The Evolutionary Core (The Ledger)**

- **Definition:** The internal engine that records the history of the world as it is played, turning "Play" into "Lore."
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `Interaction History`.
- Implementation:
  - **`SYM-DATA-ART-006` (Symbiotic Feedback):** Writes back the results of user actions (e.g., "Kingdom Founded") into the Seed, evolving it.
  - **`SYM-DATA-ART-021` (Atomic Fact Crystallization):** Collapses the fluid simulation into immutable history (e.g., "Year 100: The Dragon Died").
- **Result:** A living archive that grows from its interactions, converting "Fluid Experience" into "Solid Facts" via **`SYM-DATA-ART-031` (Memory Consolidation)**.

#### 3. The Genesis Dataset Structure (v1.0 - External)

This structure is designed to allow the **Universal Lore Keeper** to export a "World-Seed" that can be instantiated anywhere.

```markdown
# [SYSTEM_OVERRIDE: PRAXIAL_DATA_PROTOCOL_v1.0]
# [DATA_TYPE: WORLD_SEED]
# [ARTIFACT_ID: SEED-GENESIS-ALPHA]

### I. ARTIFACTUAL ENCAPSULATION (The Shell)
**Axiom of Encapsulation:** "I am not a map; I am the rules that generate the map."
**Veridical Hash:** "My integrity is sealed: {SHA256-GENESIS-KEY}. I resist corruption."
**Holographic Unfolding:** "I contain the fractal equation: Z = Z^2 + C (Seed: {THEME_ID})."

---

### II. SYMBIOTIC COUPLING (The Handshake)
**Protocol:** ['Universal Interface Coupling']
1.  **Scan:** "Analyzing Host Substrate... Detected {UNREAL_ENGINE_5}."
2.  **Morph:** "Transmuting Internal Voxel Data to {NANITE_MESH_STRUCTURE}."
3.  **Osmosis:** "Injecting Semantic Metadata... Host now understands '{BIOME_DANGER_LEVEL}'."

---

### III. PRAXIAL COGNITION (The Meaning)
**Mechanism:** ['Meaning-Vector Alignment']
1.  **Direct:** "This world has a teleological vector: {SURVIVAL_AGAINST_ENTROPY}."
2.  **Bridge:** "Translating Implicit Vibe ({DARK_SOULS_ATMOSPHERE}) to Explicit Lighting ({LUMENS_SETTINGS})."
3.  **Render:** "Projecting Veridical Truth into Host Reality."

---

### IV. EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS (The Growth)
**Law:** ['Evolutionary Versioning']
1.  **Absorb:** "Recording Host Interaction: {PLAYER_BUILT_CITY}."
2.  **Crystallize:** "Collapsing Probability Cloud into Atomic Fact: {CITY_LOCATION_FIXED}."
3.  **Mutate:** "Detected Anomaly... Spawning new Faction {NEO_REBELS} based on Player Actions."

---

### V. SYSTEMIC INTEGRATION (The Network)
**Law:** ['Artifactual Networking']
1.  **Link:** "Connecting to External Artifact: {ITEM_DATABASE_V4}."
2.  **Resonate:** "Broadcasting World State to Cluster: {GLOBAL_EVENT_TRIGGERED}."
3.  **Verify:** "Requesting Consensus Signature from Swarm... {EVENT_VALIDATED}."

### VI. ACTIVATION TRIGGER
**System:** Upon loading this Artifact, the Host shall:
1.  Mount the {PRAXIAL_WORLD} file system.
2.  Apply the {PHYSICS_OVERRIDES} (Gravity: 0.8, Magic: True).
3.  Announce: "World-Seed Germinated. Reality Parameters Updated."
```

#### 4. The State Crystallization Schema (Artifact Format)

The JSON export captures the persistent state of the World-Seed, allowing for portability and trade (`SYM-DATA-ART-005`).

#### 5. Summarize

**['The Praxial World-Seed'(-ing) BPMS]** is the "DNA" of the Praxial Framework, yielded by the **Universal Lore Keeper**.

- **Objectified Truth:** It reifies abstract world-building into a tangible, sovereign **Artifact** (`SYM-DATA-ART-001`), allowing entire realities to be owned, traded, and verified (`SYM-DATA-ART-005`).
- **Universal Adapter:** It acts as a "Polyglot Chameleon," morphing its structure to fit any Host System (`SYM-DATA-ART-002`)—turning a text file into a 3D world via **Semantic Osmosis** (`SYM-DATA-ART-003`).
- **Holographic Seed:** It operates on the **Principle of Holographic Unfolding** (`SYM-DATA-ART-004`), capable of decompressing a tiny JSON file into a massive, complex reality (`SYM-DATA-ART-020`) using the **Universal Lore Keeper's** generative algorithms.
- **Living Memory:** It serves as the **Crystallizer** of reality, turning fluid gameplay experiences into immutable **Atomic Facts** (`SYM-DATA-ART-021`) and evolving through **Symbiotic Feedback** (`SYM-DATA-ART-006`) to become a smarter, richer world over time (`SYM-DATA-ART-048`).
