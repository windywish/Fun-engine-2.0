- **Scope of Application:** Global Context (The "Truth" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#convenience-store #services #world-seed #lore #physics #axioms #hyper-convenience`

## 1. Thematic Core

**Genre:** Algorithmic Solarpunk / Cyber-Logistics Utopia.

**Mood:** Responsive, Fluid, Anticipatory, Ubiquitous. The atmosphere is one of "Aggressive Care"—the world itself seems to be constantly leaning in to ask, "What do you need?" There is a low-level hum of drones and the soft glow of AR overlays everywhere. It is a world without waiting, without friction, and without want, but also perhaps without the silence of being truly alone.

**Central Conflict:** The tension between **The Axiom of Anticipatory Provisioning** and **The Human Need for Agency**. The world is so efficient at predicting needs that characters may struggle to distinguish between their *actual* desires and the desires the System *predicted* for them. The conflict is not "Man vs. Nature" or "Man vs. Machine," but "Man vs. The Path of Least Resistance."

**Narrative Axiom:** "In a world where you can have anything instantly, the only luxury left is the time to want it."

## 2. Physics & Metaphysics

**The Physics of Flow:**

- **The Law of Material Permeability:** The city architecture is designed for **['The Hyper-Convenience Flow'(-ing) BPMS]**. Walls have "Drone Ports." Windows are delivery hatches. The physical structure of the world is porous to the movement of goods.
- **The Principle of Field Localization:** Objects are not "static." A coffee cup is not "on the table"; it is "currently localized at coordinates X,Y,Z but subject to immediate relocation." The world feels kinetic; inanimate objects seem to have a low-level agency (via the Service).

**The Metaphysics of Value:**

- **Credit as Potential Energy:** In this world, money is literally treated as physics. A user with high credits has high "Potential Energy"—they can bend the flow of matter (goods) towards them with greater force. A user with low credits has high "Kinetic Necessity"—they must move towards the goods.

- The Augmented Ontology:

   Reality is bifurcated.

  - **The Substrate:** The grey, functional concrete of the physical city.
  - **The Overlay:** The vibrant, colorful, informative AR layer where the "Service" lives. To remove one's AR glasses is to go blind to the true operation of the world.

**The Rules of Interaction:**

- **No Transaction is Silent:** Every interaction (picking up an apple, opening a door) generates an **[atomic fact(-ing) BPMS]**. The world remembers everything.
- **The Speed of Truth:** Information travels instantly. If a product is recalled, it turns red in the user's hand immediately. There is no lag between "Knowledge" and "Reality."

## 3. Geography & Locations

**The Hubs (The Hearts):** Massive, windowless, monolithic structures in the district centers. They are the "Dark Stores"—the hives where the **['The Instant Gratification Nexus'(-ing) BPMS]** lives. They hum with the sound of millions of robotic pickers. They are the source of the "Flow."

- *Visual:* Brutalist concrete wrapped in shimmering holographic ads.

**The Flow-Zones (The Arteries):** Streets are no longer for cars. They are multi-layered "Streams."

- *Layer 1 (Ground):* Pedestrians and "Roaming Vending Rovers."
- *Layer 2 (Mid-Air):* Delivery Drones (The Swarm) moving in murmuration patterns.
- *Layer 3 (High-Air):* Heavy-lift cargo haulers moving entire modular store units.

**The Silence Districts (The Voids):** Ultra-exclusive zones for the wealthy where the "Service" is invisible. Here, the AR overlay is muted. Drones are disguised as birds. The "Convenience" is hidden to simulate a "Natural" life.

- *Visual:* Green parks, quiet streets, no holographic ads.

**The Pulse Points (The Nodes):** Public plazas where the **Field Localization** is densest. These are dynamic marketplaces that change shape every hour based on the **Meso-Loop** (e.g., a Coffee Plaza in the morning morphs into a Noodle Market at night).

- *Visual:* A chaotic, colorful dance of modular pods docking and undocking, surrounded by crowds of users.

**The Extinction Zones (The Shadows):** Areas where the **[praxial signature(-ing) BPMS]** cannot be read (e.g., deep underground, shielded basements). Here, the "Service" fails. The AR overlay flickers and dies. Users feel a sudden, terrifying isolation—the "Withdrawal" from the Hyper-Convenience Flow.
