- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['world-building axiom'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To define the immutable static lore, physics constants, and geographical axioms that the World-Engine must render, specifically focusing on the **Ontological Primacy of the Task**.

### 1. Thematic Core

**Genre:** Industrial-Fantasy / Clockwork-Post-Apocalypse. **Mood:** Desperate, Rhythm-Obsessed, Constructivist. **Central Conflict:** **Entropy vs. Industry.**

In Aethelgard, reality is not a given; it is a product. The world exists only as long as it is being "worked" on. The `[void(-ing) BPMS]` (The Unmade) constantly gnaws at the edges of the world, dissolving matter back into potential energy.

The inhabitants, known as **The Forgers**, do not perform tasks to *gain* rewards; they perform tasks to *sustain* existence. A "Task" is a sacred ritual of binding reality together. If the Forgers stop working, the sun stops moving, the ground dissolves into mist, and time freezes.

This theme perfectly implements `TASK-SURV-038` (Metabolic Persistence) and `TASK-CORE-001` (Quantized Action) as the central narrative pillars.

### 2. Physics & Metaphysics

This section defines how the `[task(-ing) BPMS]` Basic Settings are implemented as physical laws within Aethelgard.

#### **2.1. The Law of Quantized Existence (Implementing `TASK-CORE-001`)**

- **Axiom:** "Matter is Frozen Action."
- **Physics:** Objects in Aethelgard have a `Stability_Index`. This index decays over time (Entropy). The only way to restore it is through the application of a `[task(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Effect:** A bridge that is not crossed (Task: Travel) eventually fades from existence. A sword that is not swung (Task: Combat) becomes brittle and shatters into raw code.

#### **2.2. The Chrono-Currency Standard (Implementing `TASK-TIME-045` & `TASK-VAL-046`)**

- **Axiom:** "Time is not a River; it is a Fuel."
- **Physics:** Time does not pass automatically. It is a resource called **"Chronos"** that is mined from the `[void(-ing) BPMS]` via specific rituals (Tasks).
- Effect:
  - **Personal Time:** Every Agent has a "Chronos Meter." Every action costs Chronos. If you run out, you freeze in stasis until someone else "donates" Chronos to you (Task: Resuscitate).
  - **Global Time:** The Day/Night cycle is manually cranked by the **Guild of the Gear**, who execute massive cooperative tasks (`TASK-COH-010`) to turn the World-Axle.

#### **2.3. Topological Actuation (Implementing `TASK-TOPO-041`)**

- **Axiom:** "The Path is the Walk."
- **Physics:** The wilderness is a shifting, non-Euclidean fog. It has no fixed geometry.
- **Effect:** Geometry only solidifies when an Agent accepts a "Pathfinding Task." The more Agents walk a route, the more "Real" and paved it becomes. If a road is abandoned, the fog reclaims it, and the geography shifts.

#### **2.4. The Truth-Log (Implementing `TASK-FACT-005` & `TASK-TRUTH-020`)**

- **Axiom:** "If it is not Written, it did not Happen."
- **Physics:** The **"Great Ledger"** is a physical monolith in the center of the world.
- **Effect:** When a Task is completed, a beam of light shoots from the Agent to the Ledger, inscribing the `['atomic fact'(-ing) BPMS]`. Magic works by citing these facts. You cannot cast a "Fireball" unless you can cite a historical precedent of fire in the Ledger.

### 3. Geography & Locations

These locations are procedural manifestations of the Symbiotic Task Settings.

#### **3.1. The Unforged Wastes (The Implicit Layer - `TASK-LAYER-016`)**

- **Description:** The chaotic borderlands where reality is still "Implicit." It is a glitching, shifting landscape of wireframe mountains and un-rendered textures.
- **Function:** The source of all raw materials (`['potential (energy)'(-ing) BPMS]`).
- **Key Task:** `[Task: Prospecting]` - The act of staring at the glitch until it collapses into a specific resource (Ore, Water, Monster).

#### **3.2. The Crystallized Citadel (The Explicit Layer - `TASK-FACT-005`)**

- **Description:** The capital city, built from pure "Completed Tasks." The walls are made of millions of compressed "Mining Logs." The streets are paved with "Walking Logs." It is indestructible as long as the Ledger remains intact.
- **Function:** The safe zone where Entropy is zero.
- **Key Task:** `[Task: Archiving]` - The bureaucratic maintenance of the city's structural integrity by verifying old Task Logs.

#### **3.3. The Gear-Works of Ouroboros (The Metabolic Engine - `TASK-ENER-023`)**

- **Description:** A massive industrial complex built into a volcano. It is the heart of the world's economy.
- **Function:** Converts `Kinetic Energy` (Player Action) into `Potential Energy` (Chronos/Magic).
- **Key Task:** `[Task: The Great Turning]` - A raid-level event (`TASK-COH-010`) where hundreds of players must simultaneously push the Great Gear to generate enough Chronos for the next "Day."

#### **3.4. The Echo-Forest (The Stigmergic Field - `TASK-STIG-026`)**

- **Description:** A forest where the trees are "Ghost Actions" of past players.
- **Function:** A training ground where new players can see the "Phantoms" of veterans executing perfect combat rotations.
- **Key Task:** `[Task: Mimicry]` - Aligning one's own actions perfectly with a Phantom to gain accelerated XP (`TASK-EVO-034`).
