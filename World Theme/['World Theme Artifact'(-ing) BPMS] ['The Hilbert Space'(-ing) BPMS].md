## ['World Theme Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Hilbert Space'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `SEED-WORLD-HILBERT-001`
- **Name:** `['The Hilbert Space'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Origin/Implementer(Parent instance):** `['scientific verification'(-ing) BPMS]:['Praxial Ontology Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Axiomatic Core']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['mathematical reality definition'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To encapsulate the specific mathematical and logical axioms that define the "Possibility Space" of a simulation, serving as the configuration file that the **['Praxial Ontology Engine']** loads to enforce reality constraints.
- **Scope of Application:** Global Context (The "Geometry" and "Logic" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#scientific-verification #praixial-ontology-engine #hilbert-space #axioms #ontology #math-physics #context`

## 1. Thematic Core

**"The Hilbert Space"** is the abstract definition of the "Playground of Truth." It does not describe a specific story (like "Cyberpunk"), but rather the **Mathematical Stage** upon which any story must unfold.

- **Genre:** Abstract Mathematical / Logical / Physical.
- **Mood:** Rigorous, Infinite, Precise, Crystalline.
- **Central Conflict:** Consistency vs. Paradox. The space strives to remain internally consistent despite the chaotic actions of agents.
- **Function:** It acts as the "Container" for the simulation's reality. It tells the **['Praxial Ontology Engine']** which "Language Game" is being played (e.g., Euclidean Geometry, Quantum Mechanics, Newtonian Physics).

## 2. Physics & Metaphysics

This artifact defines the **Hard Constraints** that the **['Praxial Ontology Engine']** will enforce via the **['Praxial Veridical Engine']**.

**A. Geometric Axioms (The Space):**

- Metric Tensor:

   Defines how distance is measured.

  - *Option A (Euclidean):* `ds² = dx² + dy² + dz²` (Flat space).
  - *Option B (Minkowski):* `ds² = -c²dt² + dx² + dy² + dz²` (Relativistic space).
  - *Option C (Graph):* Distance = Number of hops between nodes (Network space).

- Topology:

   Defines connectivity.

  - *Open:* Infinite in all directions.
  - *Closed:* Wraps around (Pac-Man world / Torus).
  - *Bounded:* Has invisible walls.

**B. Logical Axioms (The Rules):**

- **Law of Non-Contradiction:** `NOT (A AND NOT A)` is always True. (Standard Logic).
- **Causality:** `Cause` must precede `Effect` in time `t`.
- Conservation Laws:
  - `Energy_In = Energy_Out` (Thermodynamics).
  - `Mass` is conserved (unless `E=mc²` is active).

**C. Ontological Tags (The Filter):**

- **Allowed Types:** `#Math`, `#Logic`, `#Geometry`, `#Physics`.
- **Banned Types:** `#Magic` (unless explicitly defined as a physics branch), `#Ambiguity`, `#Hallucination`.

## 3. Geography & Locations

In "The Hilbert Space," locations are not cities or mountains, but **Mathematical Domains**.

- **Domain A: The Euclidean Plane:**
  - *Description:* A perfectly flat, infinite 2D surface.
  - *Rules:* Parallel lines never meet. Angles of a triangle sum to 180°.
  - *Inhabitants:* Geometric primitives (Circles, Squares, Triangles).
- **Domain B: The Quantum Well:**
  - *Description:* A probabilistic potential well.
  - *Rules:* Particles exist as wavefunctions. Position and Momentum cannot be known simultaneously (Heisenberg Uncertainty).
  - *Inhabitants:* Electrons, Photons, Probability Clouds.
- **Domain C: The Logic Gate Labyrinth:**
  - *Description:* A massive circuit of boolean logic.
  - *Rules:* Signals propagate at `c`. Gates (AND, OR, NOT) determine flow.
  - *Inhabitants:* Binary signals (0, 1), Error correction codes.
- **Domain D: The Code Sandbox:**
  - *Description:* An isolated memory space for executing algorithms.
  - *Rules:* Python 3.10 Syntax. Memory Limit = 4GB. Time Limit = 10s.
  - *Inhabitants:* Variables, Functions, Objects.

### 4.Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system**
