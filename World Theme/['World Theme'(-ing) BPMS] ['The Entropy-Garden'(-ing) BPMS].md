## ['World Theme'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Entropy-Garden'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `SEED-WORLD-ENTROPY-GARDEN-001`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial World-Seed'(-ing) BPMS]:[The Entropy-Garden]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Axiomatic Core']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['world-building axiom'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To instantiate a reality where **Survival is a Verb** (`CSE-CORE-001`) and the environment itself is a "Perpetual Crucible" that forces entities to evolve or face deletion.
- **Scope of Application:** Global Context (The "Truth" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#world-seed #evolutionary-horror #glitch-physics #axioms`

## 1. Thematic Core

- **Genre:** **Algorithmic Survival Horror / Evolutionary Sci-Fi.**
- **Mood:** **High-Stakes, Fluid, Glitch-Laden.** The atmosphere is one of "Beautiful Danger." The sky is not a static texture but a swirling "Code-Storm" of raw data.
- **Central Conflict:** **Adaptation vs. Obsolescence.** There is no "Evil Overlord." The antagonist is **Entropy** itself. The world constantly updates its own logic (`CSE-CORE-002`), and inhabitants must "patch" themselves in real-time to remain compatible.
- **The Golden Rule:** "That which does not kill you, compiles into your source code." (`CSE-CORE-004`).

## 2. Physics & Metaphysics

- **The Law of The Stressor (Entropy Injection):**

  - Based on `CSE-CORE-001`.
  - **Rule:** Reality is not stable. Every cycle, the system injects "Micro-Crises" (e.g., gravity shifts, atmosphere turns toxic, language scrambles).
  - **Effect:** Passive existence is impossible. Standing still drive/trigger "Bit-Rot" (damage over time).

- **The Metaphysics of Crystallization:**

  - Based on `CSE-CORE-004` (Atomic Fact Crystallization).
  - **Rule:** Truth is a physical resource. When an entity survives a crisis, the solution crystallizes into a glowing shard called an **"Atomic Fact."**
  - **Effect:** These shards are the currency, fuel, and building material of the world. You literally build your home out of your survived traumas.

- **The Chrono-Gearbox (Dual-Speed Time):**

  - Based on `CSE-CORE-007`.

  - Rule:

     Time flows at two speeds.

    - **The Core (Slow Mode):** Safe, stable, but low reward. Time moves normally.
    - **The Edge (Fast Mode):** Chaos, high mutation, high reward. Time moves at 100x speed. A minute in the Edge is a week of evolution.

- **The Field-Particle Duality:**

  - Based on `CSE-CORE-018`.
  - **Rule:** Belief shapes Physics. If enough entities believe a bridge exists, it manifests.
  - **Effect:** "Cults of Physics" form, where groups chant axioms to alter local gravity or material properties.

## 3. Geography & Locations

- **The Renormalization Tower (The Spire):**
  - Based on `CSE-CORE-008`.
  - **Description:** A massive, fractal structure at the center of the world. It is where "Micro-Truths" are uploaded to become "Global Laws."
  - **Function:** The only safe zone. Entities climb it to upload their Atomic Facts.
- **The Deprecated Zones (The Wastes):**
  - Based on `CSE-CORE-002` (Constructive Disruption).
  - **Description:** Regions where the physics engine has been "disrupted" or abandoned. Logic is broken here (e.g., rain falls up, silence is loud).
  - **Function:** High-risk scavenging grounds for "Legacy Code" (ancient powerful artifacts).
- **The Unknown Horizons (The Void):**
  - Based on `CSE-CORE-010`.
  - **Description:** The edge of the map. It is not empty; it is *unrendered*. It is a white fog of pure potential.
  - **Function:** Explorers ("Void-Walkers") venture here to force the engine to generate new land. This is the ultimate act of **Niche Construction** (`CSE-CORE-003`).
- **The Mnestic Sea:**
  - Based on `CSE-CORE-011`.
  - **Description:** A liquid ocean of "Short-Term Memory." It dissolves anything that isn't "Consolidated" (saved).
  - **Function:** Entities must cross it to reach the Tower, but staying too long washes away their identity.
