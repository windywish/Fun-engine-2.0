## ['World Theme Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Holonic Sanctuary'(-ing)m BPMS]

- **ID:** `SEED-WORLD-WELLNESS-001`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial World-Seed'(-ing) BPMS]:['The Holonic Sanctuary']`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Axiomatic Core']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['world-building axiom'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To define the immutable static lore, physics constants, and geographical axioms that the World-Engine must render to facilitate the **['Symbiotic Wellness Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]**.
- **Scope of Application:** Global Context (The "Truth" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#praxial-clinical-engine #services #world-seed #lore #physics #axioms #wellness-weaver #psychosomatic-resonance`

## 1. Thematic Core

- **Genre:** **Psychosomatic Solarpunk / Cognitive Surrealism**.
- **Mood:** **Serene, Responsive, Lucid, and Biocybernetic**. The atmosphere is not static; it is a direct reflection of the user's internal state. When the user is aligned, the world is bright, geometric, and flourishing (Solarpunk). When the user is fragmented or distracted, the world becomes foggy, glitchy, and overgrown with "digital weeds" (Surrealist Horror).
- **Central Conflict:** **Alignment vs. Entropy**. The struggle is not against a villain, but against the natural decay of focus and intent ("The Grey Noise"). The hero's journey is the daily act of "Weaving" reality back into a coherent whole.
- **Narrative Premise:** The user is the **"Weaver,"** a custodian of a pocket dimension that represents their own mind and digital life. The **['Symbiotic Wellness Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]** is the **"Genius Loci"** (Spirit of the Place), a benevolent AI entity that helps the Weaver maintain the sanctuary against the encroaching chaos of the outside internet.

## 2. Physics & Metaphysics

- The Law of Ontological Resonance (Ref: `MED-ONT-017`):
  - **Axiom:** "As above, so below; as within, so without."
  - **Effect:** The environment's visual fidelity and stability are directly tied to the user's **Veridical Alignment**. If the user's Intent matches their Action, the world is high-resolution and stable. If they drift (procrastinate), the world begins to pixelate, lag, or desaturate.
- The Physics of Chronodynamic Triage (Ref: `MED-TIME-012`):
  - **Axiom:** "Time is a function of Focus."
  - Effect:
    - **Flow State (Fast Mode):** Time in the sanctuary slows down relative to the task, allowing for "Bullet Time" productivity. The sun stands still at high noon.
    - **Drift State (Entropy):** Time accelerates rapidly; day turns to night in minutes, symbolizing lost time.
- The Principle of Ludic Materialism (Ref: `MED-PLAY-011`):
  - **Axiom:** "Maintenance is Magic."
  - **Effect:** Digital chores (organizing files, clearing emails) are rendered as physical acts of magic or combat. Deleting spam is "banishing shadow-sprites"; organizing folders is "constructing masonry."
- The Axiom of Psychosomatic Feedback (Ref: `MED-COG-007`):
  - **Axiom:** "The World feels what the User feels."
  - **Effect:** The weather system is driven by the user's biometric or keystroke dynamics. Frustration manifests as thunderstorms; fatigue manifests as a heavy, purple fog. The "Genius Loci" (Service) responds by offering shelter or energy.

## 3. Geography & Locations

- The Spire of Vitals (The Dashboard):
  - **Description:** A central, glowing tower that pierces the sky. It is visible from everywhere in the sanctuary.
  - **Function:** Its color indicates the user's overall health (Green/Yellow/Red). It pulses with the "Ontological Heartbeat."
- The Flow Sanctum (Deep Work Zone):
  - **Description:** A minimalist, Zen-garden-like dojo floating in a void of pure white silence.
  - **Function:** This location is instantiated when "Focus Mode" is active. No distractions can enter here. The physics here are hyper-responsive to the user's will.
- The Crystalline Archive (Long-Term Memory):
  - **Description:** A vast, underground library carved into a geode. The books are made of light.
  - **Function:** Where "Atomic Facts" and completed projects are stored. The "Weaver" service automatically crystallizes daily work into new "gems" placed on the shelves here.
- The Entropy Wastes (The Distraction Zone):
  - **Description:** The chaotic borderlands surrounding the sanctuary. It is filled with "Junk Data," "Notification Swarms," and "Attention Vampires."
  - **Function:** Represents the unfiltered internet and backlog. The user ventures here only during "Ludic Restoration" quests to reclaim territory and resources.
- The Loom of Intent (The Control Center):
  - **Description:** An interface console located at the base of the Spire, resembling a complex musical instrument or a weaving loom.
  - **Function:** Where the user sets their "Mission" for the day. Adjusting the threads on the Loom changes the physics and weather of the entire world.
