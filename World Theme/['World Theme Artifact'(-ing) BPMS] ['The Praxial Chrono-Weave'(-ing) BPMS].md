### ['World Theme Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial Chrono-Weave'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `SEED-WORLD-CHRONO-WEAVE-002`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial Chrono-Weave'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Axiomatic Core']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['world-building axiom'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To define the immutable laws of temporal resonant constellation map, historical resonance, and narrative plasticity that the World-Engine must render, specifically tailored for a reality governed by **['complex activities'(-ing) BPMS]** where time is a manipulable resource.
- **Scope of Application:** Global Context (The "History" and "Pacing" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#praxial-scenario-engine #scenario #world-seed #time-physics #resonant-constellation-map #narrative-weaving`

## 1. Thematic Core

**Genre:** **Temporal Espionage / Metaphysical Thriller**

**Mood:** **Palimpsestic, Urgent, Melancholic, Recursive.** The world feels like a document that has been written over a thousand times. There is a sense of "Déjà Vu" woven into the very atoms of the setting. Characters feel the weight of timelines that *could* have happened but didn't. The atmosphere is thick with the tension of "The Butterfly Effect"—every small action vibrates with the potential to rewrite history.

**Central Conflict:** **Memory vs. Revision (The War of the Weave).** The fundamental struggle is the **Axiom of Chrono-Kinetic Continuity**. Agents (The Weavers) strive to anchor specific events as "Canonical Truth" (Immutable History), while the Entropy of the Void (The Unraveling) seeks to dissolve resonant constellation map into a chaotic soup of unlinked moments. It is a battle to keep the story coherent against the forces of narrative nihilism.

## 2. Physics & Metaphysics

**The Laws of Reality (Derived from Chrono-Kinetic Axioms):**

- The Law of Resonant Constellation Map Viscosity (Time is Heavy):
  - *Source:* `PSE-CONT-031` & `PSE-TIME-020`
  - *Rule:* Time is not a frictionless medium. Changing the past requires an immense expenditure of **Kinetic Energy**. The more "observed" an event is (i.e., the more agents have witnessed it), the heavier it becomes and the harder it is to alter. This is the "Observer Effect" weaponized as a law of physics.
- The Law of Narrative Echoes (Resonant Frequency):
  - *Source:* `PSE-MEAN-025` & `PSE-PHEN-014`
  - *Rule:* Events that are thematically similar vibrate at the same frequency. If a betrayal happens in the present, it physically resonates with every betrayal in the past, allowing agents to "surf" these resonant waves to access ancient lore or skills. History doesn't repeat; it rhymes, and the rhymes are wormholes.
- The Law of The Palimpsest (Overwriting Reality):
  - *Source:* `PSE-FACT-002` & `PSE-MEM-057`
  - *Rule:* Reality is a writable surface. When a timeline is changed, the old timeline is not erased but "scraped" away, leaving faint traces (Ghost Data). High-perception agents can read these "Ghost Traces" to learn secrets from deleted timelines.
- The Law of Chrono-Synaptic Lag (The Time-Debt):
  - *Source:* `PSE-SYNC-053`
  - *Rule:* Using "Fast Time" (Simulation Skips) creates a metabolic debt. The user/agent must eventually "pay back" this time by engaging in "Slow Time" (Deep Work/Reflection), or suffer from "Temporal Sickness" (Desynchronization from reality).
- The Law of Teleological Gravity (Destiny is a Force):
  - *Source:* `PSE-OBJ-062` & `PSE-VECT-008`
  - *Rule:* Major Objectives (Missions) exert a physical gravitational pull. Agents find themselves "falling" towards the climax of a story arc. Coincidence is just the manifestation of this gravity pulling disparate plot threads together.

## 3. Geography & Locations

**Key Locations (Manifestations of the Axioms):**

- The Loom of Origins (The Big Bang Forge):
  - *Concept:* Based on `PSE-FACT-002` & `PSE-MEM-016`.
  - *Description:* A colossal, spinning mechanism at the center of the map where raw "Possibility" is woven into "Fact." It is the source of the **Event Stream**. Agents travel here to witness the birth of new truths or to attempt the dangerous act of "Retconning" (Retroactive Continuity).
- The Echo-Canyons (The Resonant Valleys):
  - *Concept:* Based on `PSE-PHEN-060`.
  - *Description:* Deep fissures in the reality-substrate where sound and light from the past are trapped. Walking through them allows one to hear conversations from centuries ago. It is a place of research, espionage, and madness for those who listen too long.
- The Stasis Vaults (The Immutable Archive):
  - *Concept:* Based on `PSE-MEM-050` & `PSE-ARTIFACT-054`.
  - *Description:* A fortress outside of time where **Artifacts** and **Atomic Facts** are stored in absolute zero entropy. Nothing here can change. It is the bank of "Canon," guarded by the "Keepers of the Core" (Automated Logic Daemons).
- The Flux-Tides (The Edge of the Present):
  - *Concept:* Based on `PSE-HORIZON-052`.
  - *Description:* The shifting coastline where the "Present" meets the "Future." The terrain here is unstable, constantly morphing as the **Probability Wave** collapses. Explorers (The World-Walkers) surf these tides to map the adjacent possible.
- The Null-Zones (The Deleted Scenes):
  - *Concept:* Based on `PSE-VAL-030`.
  - *Description:* Pockets of grey, featureless void where "Pruned" timelines go to die. They are dangerous glitches in the map where physics breaks down, but they contain valuable "Scrap Data" for those brave enough to salvage it.

## 4. Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system** **This artifact is designed to be the "Temporal Counterpart" to the "Spatial" World-Seed, providing the "When" and "Why" to the World-Seed's "Where" and "What".**
