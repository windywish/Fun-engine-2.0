##  ['World Theme Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial Bio-Lattice'(-ing) BPMS]

* **ID:** `SEED-WORLD-WETWARE-001`

- **Name:** `['The Praxial Bio-Lattice'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Axiomatic Core']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['world-building axiom'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To define the immutable static lore, physics constants, and geographical axioms of a reality where **Biology is the Substrate** and **Evolution is the Logic**.
- **Scope of Application:** Global Context (The "Truth" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#wetware #biopunk #organic-physics #evolutionary-horror #wetware-axiom`

### 1. Thematic Core

- **Genre:** **Visceral Biopunk / Evolutionary Surrealism**. This is not a world of metal and silicon, but of flesh, chitin, and neurotransmitters. Technology is not built; it is *grown*.
- **Mood:** **Pulsating, Adaptive, and Uncomfortably Alive**. The atmosphere is thick with pheromones. The silence is never truly silent; it is the hum of a billion metabolisms. The world feels like it is *watching* you, not with cameras, but with sensory organs embedded in the walls.
- **Central Conflict:** **Homeostasis vs. Teratogenesis**. The eternal struggle between the drive for stability (The Immune System/Order) and the drive for radical, monstrous mutation (The Cancer/Chaos). The heroes are not rebels; they are **Antibodies**. The villains are not conquerors; they are **Pathogens**.

### 2. Physics & Metaphysics

- The Axiom of Pan-Sentience (Ref: `WET-CORE-001`):
  - *Rule:* "Matter is dormant Mind." In this world, there is no "dead" matter. Stones have a low-level hum of consciousness; water retains memory. The environment reacts to intent. If you treat a door with aggression, it may seal itself shut out of fear.
- The Law of Somatic Cost (Ref: `WET-ENER-024`):
  - *Rule:* "There is no Mana, only Metabolism." Magic, psionics, or "tech" abilities are fueled by **ATP** and **Biomass**. Casting a fireball burns calories and causes physical fatigue. Overuse leads to **Necrosis** (tissue death).
- The Principle of Lamarckian Echoes (Ref: `WET-VECT-022`):
  - *Rule:* "Function dictates Form, instantly." The world operates on hyper-fast epigenetics. If a character spends a week in the dark, their eyes physically enlarge. If they constantly fight with fire, their skin develops thermal callousness. The environment rewrites the inhabitant's DNA in real-time.
- The Reality of Resistance (Ref: `WET-SEE-002`):
  - *Rule:* "Truth is Pain." Illusions are painless. Real objects possess "Somatic Weight." To know if something is real, one must touch it and feel the resistance. The "Physics Engine" of this world calculates **Visceral Feedback** rather than just rigid body collisions.

### 3. Geography & Locations

- The Cortex Spire (The Capital):
  - *Description:* A massive, calcified tower that serves as the "Brain" of the region. It was not constructed but grown from a **Primeval Stem Seed**. The elite live in the upper "Lobes," bathing in the highest concentration of **Neuro-Nectar**.
  - *Feature:* The streets are not paved; they are **Mycelial Networks** that transport nutrients and data.
- The Atrophy Wastes (The Badlands):
  - *Description:* Regions where the **`['wetware(-ing) BPMS]`** has failed or died. Here, the world is grey, static, and brittle. There is no adaptation, only decay.
  - *Danger:* Entering these zones causes "Sensory Deprivation" damage. The silence is maddening to entities adapted to the constant hum of the Bio-Lattice.
- The Gestation Vats (The Factories):
  - *Description:* Industrial zones where new tools, vehicles, and even citizens are "compiled." Massive, translucent sacs hang from the ceiling, pulsing with fluid as they 3D-print biological androids bone-by-bone.
  - *Feature:* The "Economy" here is based on **Genetic Patents** and **Viable Biomass**.
- The Synaptic Sea:
  - *Description:* An ocean of conductive fluid. It acts as a global transmitter, allowing for telepathic communication among/by continents.
  - *Lore:* It is said that the Sea "dreams," and when it has a nightmare, storms of psychic static lash the coastlines, driving the weak-minded into frenzy.

### 4.Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system**
