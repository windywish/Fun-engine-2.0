## ['World Theme Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Akashic Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `SEED-WORLD-AKASHIC-001`
- **Name:** `['The Akashic Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Axiomatic Core']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['world-building axiom'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To define a world theme where reality is literally woven from knowledge, acting as a direct implementation of the `['knowledge base'(-ing) BPMS]` as a `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Scope of Application:** Global Context (The "Truth" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#knowledge-base #world-seed #lore #physics #axioms #symbiosis #knowledge-is-power`

## 1. Thematic Core

- **Genre:** Epistemic Fantasy / Noetic Cyberpunk.
- **Mood:** Lucid, Resonant, Unfolding.
- **Central Conflict:** The tension between `The Known` (Stability/Order) and `The Unknown` (Chaos/Potential).
- **Core Concept:** The world of "Akasha" does not exist materially; it exists informationally. Objects are stable only as long as they are "Known" (recorded in the KB). Forgetting is literal destruction; Discovery is literal creation.

## 2. Physics & Metaphysics (Symbiotic Implementation)

This section defines how the World Theme implements the `['knowledge base'(-ing) BPMS]` settings as physical laws.

- **The Law of Veridical Materialization (Implementing `KB-CORE-043`):**
  - *Physics:* Reality is a projection of the Canon. If the "Veridical Coefficient" of an object drops (i.e., it contradicts the Canon), it begins to "glitch" or fade.
  - *Symbiosis:* Players stabilize the world by verifying facts. A "Quest" is often a mission to re-verify a fading town to keep it from dissolving into the Void.
- **The Principle of Kinetic Magic (Implementing `KB-CORE-044`):**
  - *Physics:* Magic is the transduction of `Potential Energy` (Lore/Secrets) into `Kinetic Energy` (Spells/Effects).
  - *Symbiosis:* To cast a fireball, one must "spend" a secret. The more obscure the knowledge, the more powerful the effect. This forces players to constantly hunt for new knowledge (charging the capacitor) to fuel their actions.
- **The Protocol of Teleological Geography (Implementing `KB-CORE-045`):**
  - *Physics:* The map is not fixed. Paths only exist if they lead to a valid `Mission`.
  - *Symbiosis:* If a player accepts a Mission to "Find the Lost City," the road to the city *instantiates* (KB-CORE-050). If they abandon the mission, the road ceases to exist. The world geometry is a function of player intent.
- **The Law of Granular Perception (Implementing `KB-CORE-046`):**
  - *Physics:* The world renders in "Low Poly" (Coarse-Grained) when viewed from afar or by the uninitiated. It only resolves into "High Definition" (Fine-Grained) when scrutinized or interacted with.
  - *Symbiosis:* "Wisdom" is the stat that allows one to see the fine grain. A novice sees a "Tree"; a master sees "Quercus robur, 300 years old, harboring a dryad."
- **The Mechanism of Ruin Folding (Implementing `KB-CORE-047`):**
  - *Physics:* History is not gone; it is "folded." Ancient civilizations are compressed into "Artifacts."
  - *Symbiosis:* Interacting with an Artifact "unfolds" the past, temporarily overlaying the ancient city onto the current ruins, allowing players to interact with the "ghosts" of complex activities long past.
- **The Directive of Causal Scars (Implementing `KB-CORE-048`):**
  - *Physics:* Every major decision leaves a physical scar on the land. A betrayal might cause a fissure; a sacrifice might bloom a forest.
  - *Symbiosis:* The landscape is a readable audit log of the players' moral and tactical choices.

## 3. Geography & Locations

- **The Spire of Consensus:** The central hub where the "Canon" is kept. It is the most stable place in the world.
- **The Mnestic Sea:** The fluid, shifting ocean of `Short-Term Memory` (STM). Islands here appear and disappear based on the collective focus of the world's inhabitants (Implementing `KB-CORE-049`).
- **The Voidlands:** The edge of the map where `Atomic Facts` (KB-CORE-051) have not yet been established. Here, logic breaks down, and raw potential seethes. Only "World-Weavers" (High-level players) can venture here to crystallize new land.

## 4. Factions & Entities

- **The Archivists:** Guardians of `['long-term (memory)'(-ing) BPMS]`. They seek to crystallize everything into immutable Canon. They fear change.
- **The Void-Walkers:** Explorers of the Unknown. They seek to introduce `Constructive Disruption` (KB-CORE-009) to keep the world growing.
- **The Tulpas:** Entities that exist only because enough people believe in them (Symbiotic Pan-Implementation `KB-CORE-052`). They are living memes.

## 5. Systemic Integration (The "Fun Engine" Hook)

- **The Wiki is the Game:** The external wiki for this game *is* the game's control panel. Editing the wiki (if permitted) literally changes the game world for everyone.
- **Lore as Currency:** Players trade "Verified Facts" as gold.
- **Evolution:** The world version increments (v1.0 -> v1.1) not by developer patch, but by the `Mnestic Consolidation` (KB-CORE-049) of player actions at the end of each "Cycle."

### 6.Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system**
