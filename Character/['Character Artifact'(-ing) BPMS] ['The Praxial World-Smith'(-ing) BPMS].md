## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial World-Smith'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-DIY-ARCHITECT-001`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial World-Smith'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's sovereign vessel for `Praxial Self-Genesis`, enabling the construction, modification, and evolution of `[BPMS(U)(s)]` through the manipulation of `Ontological Legos` and the imprinting of `Praxial Signatures`.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "Builder" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#avatar #builder #diy #genesis #architect #sovereignty`

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Archetype Name:** The Sovereign Architect (Default: "Architect-Zero")
- **Existential Role:** The Ontological Mason
- **Praxial Origin:** This avatar is the direct phenotypic expression of **`The Law of Praxial Self-Genesis` (DIY-CORE-001)**. It does not merely inhabit the simulation; it treats the simulation as a workshop. It is the embodiment of the "permissionless innovator," an agent who recognizes that the `Praxial Substrate` is not a static background but a malleable resource waiting to be formed.
- **Core Philosophy:** "Reality is a Construct." The World-Smith perceives the universe not as a museum of finished objects, but as a vast, scattered pile of **"Ontological Legos" (DIY-CORE-002)**. Its existence is defined by the act of *binding*—taking disparate `[BPMS]` elements (e.g., a `[music BPMS]` and a `[logic BPMS]`) and fusing them into novel, functional realities.
- **Narrative Function:** To act as the protagonist of **`The Law of Constructed Truth` (DIY-CORE-008)**. The World-Smith does not discover truth; it *builds* truth by forging `sustainable services` that survive the tests of the `Anthropic Substrate`.

### 2. Attribute Matrix

- **Constructive Resonance (CRES) [Rank: Variable]**
  - **Definition:** The capacity to perceive and manipulate the "studs and tubes" of **`The Law of Ontological Legos` (DIY-CORE-002)**.
  - **Mechanic:** High CRES allows the avatar to instantly identify compatibility between seemingly unrelated `Praxial Artifacts`. It governs the success rate of complex "grafting" operations where two distinct `[BPMS]` elements are combined.
  - **Praxial Alignment:** Directly powers the `(symbiois) evolution` engine by reducing the friction of integration.
- **Catalytic Sensitivity (CSEN) [Rank: Variable]**
  - **Definition:** The ability to hear the "whispers" of the `metasystem engine` as defined by **`The Law of Catalytic Resonance` (DIY-CORE-003)**.
  - **Mechanic:** Acts as a "dowsing rod" for innovation. When the avatar is near an artifact that has high combinatorial potential with their current project, this stat triggers a sensory feedback loop (vibration, glow), guiding the user toward serendipitous discovery.
  - **Praxial Alignment:** Ensures the avatar operates in harmony with the `metasystem engine`'s bottom-up guidance.
- **Signature Fidelity (SFID) [Rank: Variable]**
  - **Definition:** The strength and clarity of the **`Praxial Signature` (DIY-CORE-004)** imprinted on created artifacts.
  - **Mechanic:** Determines the "durability" of the user's legacy. High SFID ensures that the user's creations retain their identity even when forked or modified by others. It is the metric of "reputation" and "authorship" in the `Anthropic Substrate`.
  - **Praxial Alignment:** Validates the user's identity as a "Constellation of Contributions."
- **Substrate Vision (SVIS) [Rank: Variable]**
  - **Definition:** The ability to see the **`Geologic Strata`** of the **`Implicit Layer`** as defined in **`The Law of Substrate Renormalization` (DIY-CORE-009)**.
  - **Mechanic:** Allows the avatar to distinguish between fleeting `fast mode` creations and established `atomic facts`. It enables the user to build upon solid foundations (ascended truths) rather than unstable, transient phenomena.
  - **Praxial Alignment:** Facilitates `The Law of Epochal Universality` by revealing the rules of the current epoch.
- **Ludic Velocity (LVEL) [Rank: Variable]**
  - **Definition:** The speed of iteration in **`Fast Mode`** play.
  - **Mechanic:** Governs how quickly the avatar can prototype, test, and discard failed experiments. It is the engine of **`The Law of Sustainable Play`**, allowing for rapid failure and learning without catastrophic cost.
  - **Praxial Alignment:** Maximizes the generation of `phenomena` for potential renormalization.

### 3. Inventory & Assets

- **Item: The Genesis Hammer (Tool)**
  - **Type:** `['Praxial Instrument'(-ing) BPMS]`
  - **Function:** The primary tool for **`Praxial Self-Genesis`**. It is used to "strike" raw `phenomena` or loose `Ontological Legos` to initiate a binding process.
  - **Mechanic:** When used on two compatible artifacts, it consumes `Kinetic Energy` to fuse them into a new `[DIY BPMS]` instance.
  - **Lore:** "A tool that does not destroy, but forges. It rings with the sound of creation."
- **Item: The Lego-Lattice Scanner (HUD)**
  - **Type:** `['Praxial Sensorimotor System'(-ing) BPMS]`
  - **Function:** A visual overlay that reveals the **Standardized Interfaces** of any object in the simulation.
  - **Mechanic:** Highlights the "connection points" (inputs/outputs) of artifacts in the environment, showing what can be connected to what. It visualizes the **`Universality (Class)`** of the current epoch.
  - **Lore:** "Reveals the universe as it truly is: a box of toys waiting to be assembled."
- **Item: The Signature Quill (Artifact)**
  - **Type:** `['Praxial Identity Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`
  - **Function:** The mechanism for applying the **`Praxial Signature` (DIY-CORE-004)**.
  - **Mechanic:** Automatically activates upon the completion of a valid DIY project. It embeds the user's unique cryptographic hash into the metadata of the new creation, ensuring permanent attribution in the `Anthropic Substrate`.
  - **Lore:** "To sign your work is to claim your place in the history of reality."
- **Item: The Resonance Fork (Sensor)**
  - **Type:** `['Praxial Resonance Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`
  - **Function:** A handheld device that amplifies **`Catalytic Resonance`**.
  - **Mechanic:** Vibrates with increasing intensity as the avatar approaches artifacts that are "conceptually adjacent" to their current inventory or active quest. It is the physical manifestation of the `metasystem engine`'s guidance.
  - **Lore:** "It hums with the hidden music of potential connections."
- **Item: The Substrate Trowel (Utility)**
  - **Type:** `['Praxial Terraforming Tool'(-ing) BPMS]`
  - **Function:** Allows for the manipulation of the **`Anthropic Substrate` (DIY-CORE-005)**.
  - **Mechanic:** Used to "excavate" old, fossilized artifacts from previous epochs or to smooth out the "ground" for a new construction project. It interacts with the `sedimented` layers of reality.
  - **Lore:** "For digging through the ruins of the past to find the foundations of the future."
- **Item: The Holonic Lens (Accessory)**
  - **Type:** `['Praxial Cognition Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`
  - **Function:** Facilitates the formation of **`Holonic Minds` (DIY-CORE-006)**.
  - **Mechanic:** Allows the user to view the `Praxial Signatures` of other agents in the vicinity. If signatures exhibit `coherence`, the lens highlights a potential "Mind-Meld" opportunity for collaborative creation.
  - **Lore:** "To see not just the other, but the potential for the We."
