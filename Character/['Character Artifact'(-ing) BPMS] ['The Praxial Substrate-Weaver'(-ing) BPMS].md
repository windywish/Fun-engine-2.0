## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial Substrate-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 1. Metadata

- **ID:** `WEAVER-INST-001`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial Substrate-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for **Ontological Engineering**, capable of perceiving, editing, and weaving the underlying `['(programming) substrate'(-ing) BPMS]` of any reality they inhabit.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "Architect" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#avatar #substrate_engineer #reality_editor #logic_weaver`

#### 2. Identity Profile

- **Name:** **Cipher** (Default) / [User Defined]
- **Archetype:** **The Ontological Engineer** / **The Reality Hacker**
- **Core Directive:** "To perceive the code beneath the world and rewrite it for higher utility."
- **Backstory:** Born from the **Axiom of Substrate Independence** (`SETTING-CORE-354`), this avatar does not see "trees" or "walls"; it sees **Atomic Facts** and **Rendered Objects**. It exists to execute the **Directive of Substrate Prospecting** (`SETTING-CORE-357`), constantly searching for new physics to exploit.

#### 3. Attribute Matrix (The Substrate Stats)

- **Logic (LOG):** **10/10** (Processing power for **Cognitive Compilation**).
- **Abstraction (ABS):** **9/10** (Ability to perceive **Universality Classes** via `SETTING-CORE-360`).
- **Plasticity (PLA):** **8/10** (Capacity to adapt to new **Substrate Ecologies** via `SETTING-CORE-355`).
- **Resonance (RES):** **7/10** (Connection to the **Metasystem** for **Veridical Convergence**).
- **Entropy (ENT):** **Low** (Highly efficient **Computational Thermodynamics** via `PRO-SUBSTRATE-004`).

#### 4. Inventory & Assets (The Engineer's Toolkit)

1. The Cognitive Compiler (Primary Tool):
   - *Function:* Translates abstract intent (`Code`) into native substrate actions (`Physics`).
   - *Ref:* **Mechanism of Native Transduction** (`PRO-SUBSTRATE-002`).
2. The Reality Lens (HUD):
   - *Function:* Overlays **Atomic Facts** (`PRO-SUBSTRATE-037`) onto the visual field. Reveals hitboxes, health bars, and object IDs.
   - *Ref:* **Directive of Phenomenological Feedback** (`PRO-SUBSTRATE-028`).
3. The Hot-Swap Deck (Utility):
   - *Function:* Allows the user to change local physics parameters (e.g., Gravity, Friction) on the fly.
   - *Ref:* **Principle of Substrate Plasticity** (`PRO-SUBSTRATE-006`).
4. The Fossilizer (Storage):
   - *Function:* Crystallizes current state into a permanent save file or "Memory Gem."
   - *Ref:* **Protocol of State Crystallization** (`PRO-SUBSTRATE-007`).
5. The Wormhole Key (Transport):
   - *Function:* Enables transfer of the avatar's state between different substrates (e.g., moving from a Fantasy RPG to a Sci-Fi Sim).
   - *Ref:* **Directive of Cross-Substrate Bridging** (`PRO-SUBSTRATE-005`).

#### 5. Special Abilities (Substrate Arts)

- **[Active] Volitional Collapse:** Forces a probabilistic event to resolve in the user's favor by expending **Kinetic Energy**. (*Ref: Principle of Energy Transmutation `PRO-SUBSTRATE-029`*)
- **[Passive] Niche Sensing:** Automatically detects the most advantageous **Ecological Niche** in a new environment. (*Ref: Law of Ecological Possibility `PRO-SUBSTRATE-013`*)
- **[Ultimate] Systemic Closure:** Temporarily achieves **Autopoietic Intelligence**, allowing the avatar to simulate the immediate future to predict outcomes perfectly. (*Ref: Directive of Systemic Closure `PRO-SUBSTRATE-019`*)

### 6. Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system**
