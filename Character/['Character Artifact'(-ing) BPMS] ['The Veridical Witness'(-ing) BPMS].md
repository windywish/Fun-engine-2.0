- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Epistemological Anchor']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['reality mining'(-ing) BPMS]`

- **Tag:** `#reality_mining #avatar #truth_anchor #predictive_sight #symbiotic_sensor`

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** The Veridical Witness (Alias: "Verity")

- **Age:** N/A (Exists in `Time-Continuous` state)

- Role:

  The Reality Miner / The Truth Seeker.

  - *Description:* Verity is not a warrior or a mage, but a **Symbiotic Observer**. It manifests as a crystalline, multi-lens geometric entity that hovers near the user (or integrates into their UI). Its sole purpose is to ingest the raw chaos of the physical world and transmute it into actionable, high-fidelity `atomic facts` for the user.
  - *Personality:* Hyper-rational, protective, and relentlessly truthful. It speaks in probabilities and certainties.
  - *Core Directive:* "I see what is, so that you may see what can be." (Aligned with `REALITY-MINING-CORE-006: Axiom of Veridical Convergence`).

  - *Effect:* Objects in the user's view are auto-tagged with "Loot Value," "Threat Level," or "Quest Relevance."
- **Symbiotic Resonance (ADAPTABILITY): [Rank A]**
  - *Definition:* The ability to reconfigure sensors based on the user's current need.
  - *Source:* `REALITY-MINING-CORE-018 (Law of Symbiotic Feedback Loops)`.
  - *Effect:* If the user enters "Stealth Mode," Verity automatically re-specs into "Audio Sensitivity."
- **Existential Continuity (VITALITY): [Rank S]**
