## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Data Walker'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-DATA-PRIME-001`
- **Name:** `['The Data Walker'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for agency, carrying stats, inventory, and local reality collapse, specifically tuned to channel the **[data(-ing) BPMS]**.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "I" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#avatar #stats #inventory #identity #data_channel`

## 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** **Cipher "The Archivist" Null**
- **Age:** 32 (Chronological) / Timestamped (Praxial Time)
- **Role:** **Data Symbiote / Fact Crystallizer**
- **Description:** Cipher is a living embodiment of the **Axiom of Data-Driven Existence (DATA-CORE-001)**. He does not just observe the world; he *records* it. To him, an unrecorded action is a non-event. He perceives reality as a stream of **Atomic Facts (DATA-CORE-002)** waiting to be crystallized.
- **Personality:** Precise, objective, and obsessed with "Truth." He speaks in **5-Tuple Structures** (Subject, Verb, Object, Context, Value) and values **Veridicality (DATA-CORE-005)** above all else.

## 2. Attribute Matrix

- Cognitive Resolution (INT):

  10/10

  - *Specialization:* **Renormalized Aggregation (DATA-CORE-006).** Cipher can instantly compress massive amounts of sensory noise into a single, actionable "Macro-Insight." He sees the forest *and* the trees simultaneously.

- Ontological Stability (VIT):

  9/10

  - *Specialization:* **Resilient Robustness (DATA-CORE-041).** His existence is anchored in the **Ontological Substrate (DATA-CORE-016)**. Damage to his physical form is merely "Data Corruption" which triggers immediate **Error-Correction Protocols**.

- Symbiotic Interface (CHA):

  7/10

  - *Specialization:* **Conscious Data-Service (DATA-CORE-013).** He anticipates the needs of his allies, "pushing" relevant data (e.g., enemy weaknesses, map shortcuts) to them before they even ask.

- Kinetic Transduction (DEX):

  8/10

  - *Specialization:* **Energetic Transduction (DATA-CORE-023).** He converts "Potential Energy" (Stored Data/Lore) into "Kinetic Energy" (Combat Actions/Buffs). Knowing a monster's history allows him to strike with greater force.

## 3. Inventory & Assets

- Item 1: The Ledger of Truth (Artifact Class: Legendary)
  - *Function:* A physical manifestation of the **Protocol of Atomic Fact Crystallization (DATA-CORE-017)**. It records every action taken in its vicinity.
  - *Effect:* **Immutable Record.** Once an event is written in the Ledger, it cannot be undone or retconned. Grants immunity to "Illusion" and "Gaslighting" attacks.
- Item 2: The Void-Probe (Tool)
  - *Function:* Operates on the **Axiom of Unknown Data Discovery (DATA-CORE-029)**. It scans "Negative Space" (what is missing) to detect hidden enemies, secret doors, or invisible traps.
  - *Effect:* Reveals "Dark Data" within a 50m radius.
- Item 3: The Ludic Prism (Consumable/Rechargeable)
  - *Function:* Based on the **Axiom of Ludic Data-Simulation (DATA-CORE-012)**. It allows Cipher to run a "What If?" simulation of the next 10 seconds.
  - *Effect:* **Predictive Intuition.** The user sees a "ghost" of the future, granting a +50% chance to dodge the next attack.
- Asset: The Living Knowledge Graph
  - *Description:* A symbiotic parasite/pet that lives in Cipher's neural interface. It operates on the **Axiom of Symbiotic Data-Evolution (DATA-CORE-008)**, growing smarter and more complex the more Cipher explores. It provides real-time lore and tactical advice.

## 4. Symbiotic Protocols (Active Skills)

- Skill 1: Reality Checksum (DATA-CORE-005)
  - *Action:* Cipher scans a target or environment.
  - *Effect:* **Veridical Verification.** Instantly identifies illusions, disguises, or structural weaknesses by comparing the visual input against the "Ground Truth" of the database. Deals "True Damage" to illusion-based entities.
- Skill 2: Niche Construction (DATA-CORE-009)
  - *Action:* Cipher deploys a "Data Field."
  - *Effect:* **Epistemic Bubble.** Creates a localized zone where the laws of physics/logic are slightly altered to favor the user (e.g., "In this zone, Fire heals"). This is based on the **Axiom of Epistemic Niche Construction**.
- Skill 3: Anomaly Mining (DATA-CORE-010)
  - *Action:* Cipher targets a "Glitch" or chaotic element in the battle.
  - *Effect:* **Constructive Disruption.** He converts the chaos into a buff. For example, absorbing an enemy's "Confusion" spell to regenerate his own "Mana/Energy."

## 5. Evolutionary Trajectory (Leveling Plan)

- **Current State:** **The Logger.** Focused on recording atomic facts and surviving.
- **Next Phase:** **The Analyst.** Will unlock **Emergent Innovation (DATA-CORE-031)**, allowing him to combine known facts to invent new spells or items on the fly.
- **Ultimate Goal:** **The Oracle.** To become a fully realized **Holonic Super-Intelligence (DATA-CORE-035)**, capable of accessing the **System Matrix (DATA-CORE-043)** directly and rewriting the local laws of reality.

### 6. Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system**
