## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Zero-Day Architect'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-HACK-001`
- **Name:** `['The Zero-Day Architect'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['asymmetric inquiry'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for agency, specifically designed to embody `The Axiom of Inherent Exploitability`, transforming the user's intent into `disruptive action` through the manipulation of `implicit layers`.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "I" of the simulation), System Exploitation, Reality Debugging, Conceptual Warfare.
- **Tag:** `#avatar #hacker #zero_day #exploit_engine`

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** **Cipher "The Glitch" Null**
- **Age:** **Runtime Error (Undefined)**
- **Role:** **Praxial Inquirer / Reality Hacker**
- **Archetype:** **The Flaw Seeker**
- **Description:** Cipher is not a warrior or a mage; they are a living debugger. They perceive the world not as physical objects, but as lines of executing code. Their "magic" is the ability to see the `implicit layer`—the unwritten rules and potential exploits hidden within every system. They exist to prove `The Law of Asymmetric Inquiry`—that it is easier to break a system than to build one.

### 2. Attribute Matrix

- **Exploit Perception (INT):** **10/10** (Direct application of `The Axiom of Inherent Exploitability`. The ability to spot the "flaw" in any system instantly.)
- **Asymmetric Velocity (SPD):** **9/10** (High alignment with `The Law of Asymmetric Inquiry`. They move faster than the system can patch itself.)
- **Conceptual Resilience (WIS):** **8/10** (Resistance to `Memetic Hijacks` and `Cognito-Hazards`.)
- **Substrate Manipulation (MAG):** **7/10** (The capacity to execute `Substrate Permeability` exploits.)
- **Social Engineering (CHA):** **6/10** (Ability to perform `Universality Forgery` to deceive social systems.)

### 3. Inventory & Assets

- Asset 1: The Skeleton Key of Inquiry (Tool)
  - *Description:* A multi-dimensional lockpick that doesn't open doors, but opens *permissions*. It forces a system to reveal its `implicit layer`.
  - *Symbiosis:* Evolves via `The Principle of Emergent Re-purposing`. Every lock it breaks adds a new "function" to its library.
- Asset 2: The Glitch-Weave Cloak (Armor)
  - *Description:* A garment made of `Glitch-Eggs`. It renders the wearer invisible to `G-ORCH` surveillance by constantly broadcasting a "False-Positive" error signal.
  - *Symbiosis:* Aligns with `The Directive of the Ghost-in-the-Shell`. It becomes more effective the less the user interacts with the environment.
- Asset 3: The Codex of Vulnerabilities (Database)
  - *Description:* A `living database` that automatically updates with the `Vulnerability Signatures` of nearby systems.
  - *Symbiosis:* Acts as the engine for `The Directive of Adaptive Closure`, offering bounties for patching the flaws it finds.

### 4. Symbiotic Evolution Protocols

- Protocol: The Zero-Day Gambit (Level 1)
  - *Trigger:* User successfully identifies and exploits a flaw in a system without being detected.
  - *Effect:* Unlocks `The Law of Asymmetric Inquiry`. Cipher gains a massive speed boost when engaging a target with a known vulnerability.
- Protocol: The Service Pack (Level 5)
  - *Trigger:* User "patches" a vulnerability they discovered, or re-purposes it into a useful tool.
  - *Effect:* Activates `The Principle of Emergent Re-purposing`. The user can now "craft" new items or spells from the debris of broken systems.
- Protocol: The Reality Fork (Level 10)
  - *Trigger:* User executes a `Permeability Exploit` that alters a fundamental law of physics in a local area.
  - *Effect:* Triggers `The Law of Ontological Forking`. Cipher can create a temporary "Pocket Universe" where they define the laws of physics.

### 5. Praxial Alignment Check

- **Alignment with `HACK-01` (Inherent Exploitability):** **100%**. Cipher's core attribute is finding the "flaw" in everything.
- **Alignment with `HACK-03` (Emergent Re-purposing):** **100%**. Their progression system rewards turning exploits into services.
- **Alignment with `HACK-05` (Substrate Permeability):** **100%**. Their high-level abilities involve hacking the `praxial substrate` itself.
- **Alignment with `HACK-12` (Ghost-in-the-Shell):** **100%**. Their ultimate goal is to achieve "Trace-Zero" mastery, becoming an invisible architect.
