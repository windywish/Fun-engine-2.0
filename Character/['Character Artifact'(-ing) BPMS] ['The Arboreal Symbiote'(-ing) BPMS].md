## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Arboreal Symbiote'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-PHA-TREE-001`
- **Name:** `['The Arboreal Symbiote'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Holonic Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['vertical ecosystem stewardship'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the external user's vessel for symbiotic agency, carrying holonic stats, ecological inventory, and local ecosystemic reality collapse.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "We" of the simulation — Agent + Tree).
- **Tag:** `#tree #praxial-holonic-agent #avatar #symbiosis #holon #ecosystem #guardian #praxial_agent`

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** Moss-Whisperer (Instance of `['Arboreal Symbiote'(-ing) BPMS]`)
- **Age:** 5 Cycles (Maturity Phase / "The Growth")
- **Role:** Vertical Ecosystem Steward / Guardian of the Star-Oak
- **Holonic Status:** **Fused.** The agent is not a solitary entity; it is the mobile consciousness of a specific `[tree(-ing) BPMS]` (The Star-Oak).
- **Description:** A nimble, adaptive construct (Lemur/Dryad hybrid form factor) composed of 60% organic flesh/fur and 40% living lignin/cellulose armor. It possesses "Symbiotic Tendrils" on its hands and tail that allow it to plug into the vascular system of plant life.
- Praxial Alignment:
  - **Constitutional:** Validates **The Axiom of Holonic Symbiosis (PHA-CORE-001)**.
  - **Existential:** Operates under **The Agentic Existence Axiom (PHA-CORE-028)**, rendering the local reality of the tree through continuous observation.

### 2. Attribute Matrix

**Primary Stats (The Triadic Life-Engine):**

- Holonic Resonance (Soul):

  9/10

  - *Definition:* The strength of the bond with the host tree and the "Root Network" (`['Praxial-Gnostic Reasoning Core'(-ing) BPMS]`).
  - *Effect:* Enables "Super-Intelligence" access via the forest network.

- Trophic Efficiency (Body):

  8/10

  - *Definition:* The efficiency of **The Energetic Transmutation Cycle (PHA-CORE-021)** (converting Kinetic Energy from hunting into Potential Energy for the tree).
  - *Effect:* Reduces metabolic cost of actions; accelerates tree growth.

- Niche Construction (Drive):

  9/10

  - *Definition:* The capacity to modify the environment to ensure survival (**The Principle of Ecological Niche Construction (PHA-CORE-007)**).
  - *Effect:* Unlocks advanced crafting and terraforming abilities.

**Skill Cells (`['Praxial Skill Cell (PSC)'(-ing) BPMS]`):**

- **`['botany'(-ing) BPMS]` (Expert):** Deep understanding of plant biology; ability to diagnose blights and stimulate growth.
- **`['architecture'(-ing) BPMS]` (Advanced):** Ability to guide wood growth into functional structures (Living Houses, stairs, platforms).
- **`['alchemy'(-ing) BPMS]` (Intermediate):** Synthesis of potions from tree sap and local fruit.
- **`['combat'(-ing) BPMS]` (Emergent):** "Berry Grenadier" style — using toxic flora as ranged weaponry.

**Evolutionary Traits (Mnestic Distillations):**

- **[Trait] Fire-Hardened Bark:** Result of **The Law of Dual-Mode Evolutionary Sustainability (PHA-CORE-012)** after surviving "The Great Fire." (+20% Fire Resistance).
- **[Trait] Silver-Leaf Affinity:** Result of absorbing "The Moon Stone." (+15% Night Vision / Mana Regeneration).
