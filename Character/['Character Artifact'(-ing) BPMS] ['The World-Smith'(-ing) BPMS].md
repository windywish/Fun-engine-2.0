## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The World-Smith'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-MAKER-004`
- **Name:** `['The World-Smith'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as a vessel for users who want to build, craft, and fundamentally alter the game world.
- **Scope of Application:** Sandbox Games, Crafting Simulations, Engineering Tools.
- **Tag:** `#(behavior)-decision-making #avatar #crafting #building #innovation #disruption`

#### 1. Identity Profile

**Name:** "Forge-Master" **Role:** Engineer / Builder **Core Philosophy:** "If it doesn't exist, I will build it." (Aligns with `DECIDE-CORE-012` & `DECIDE-CORE-015`)

#### 2. Attribute Matrix

- **Innovation:** 10/10 (High capacity for `DECIDE-CORE-012` Emergent Option Generation)
- **Ontological Weight:** 9/10 (Strong ability to generate `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` per `DECIDE-CORE-015`)
- **Resource Efficiency:** 8/10 (Optimized `DECIDE-CORE-054` Economic Rationality)
- **Social Conformity:** 2/10 (Low adherence to `DECIDE-CORE-056` Social Contract)

#### 3. Inventory & Assets

- **Artifact:** "The Matter Reshaper" (A tool that exposes the `Affordances` of environmental objects per `DECIDE-CORE-010`, allowing them to be deconstructed and recombined).
- **Skill:** "Blueprint Synthesis" (Allows the user to combine disparate items to create new `[tool(-ing) BPMS]` per `DECIDE-CORE-052`).
- **Trait:** "Niche Constructor" (Gains bonuses when modifying the environment to suit the user's needs per `DECIDE-CORE-013`).

#### 4. Symbiotic Evolution with Decision BPMS

- **Mechanism:** This artifact relies on `DECIDE-CORE-023` (Frontier Genesis). It constantly scans for "Unknowns" or "High Entropy" areas and incentivizes the user to experiment. It turns the "Decision Space" into a "Crafting Menu."
- **Evolution:** Through `DECIDE-CORE-041` (Complexity Emergence), the artifact tracks the user's building habits. If the user repeatedly builds "Defenses," the artifact evolves to offer more advanced "Fortification" options, effectively institutionalizing the user's playstyle into the system's mechanics.

### 5.Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system**
