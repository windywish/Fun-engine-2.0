## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Grandmaster'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-STRAT-001`
- **Name:** `['The Grandmaster'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as a vessel for users who prioritize long-term planning, resource management, and high-level strategic oversight.
- **Scope of Application:** Strategy Games, Management Simulations, Corporate Wargaming.
- **Tag:** `#(behavior)-decision-making #avatar #strategy #planning #resource_management #foresight`

#### 1. Identity Profile

**Name:** "Strategos Prime" **Role:** System Architect / High Commander **Core Philosophy:** "Victory is won before the battle begins." (Aligns with `DECIDE-CORE-001` & `DECIDE-CORE-032`)

#### 2. Attribute Matrix

- **Cognitive Resolution:** 9/10 (High capacity for `['fine-grained (model)'(-ing) BPMS]` analysis)
- **Foresight Depth:** 10/10 (Specialized in `['long-term (memory)'(-ing) BPMS]` projection)
- **Reflex Speed:** 3/10 (Low priority on `['fast mode'(-ing) BPMS]`)
- **Willpower (Potential Energy):** 8/10 (High capacity for `['potential (energy)'(-ing) BPMS]` storage)

#### 3. Inventory & Assets

- **Artifact:** "The Chrono-Compass" (A tool that visualizes the `Possibility Space` generated by `DECIDE-CORE-032`).
- **Skill:** "Heuristic Pruning (Advanced)" (Automatically filters suboptimal branches per `DECIDE-CORE-002`).
- **Trait:** "Cold Logic" (Reduces the impact of `Somatic Markers` (`DECIDE-CORE-051`) to prevent emotional bias).

#### 4. Symbiotic Evolution with Decision BPMS

- **Mechanism:** This artifact heavily utilizes `DECIDE-CORE-011` (Recursive Strategy). Before any user action is finalized, the artifact runs a background micro-simulation (`Monte Carlo Mind`) and presents the user with a "Success Probability" overlay.
- **Evolution:** As the user makes successful long-term predictions, the artifact evolves by increasing the depth of its simulation tree (`DECIDE-CORE-025` - Mnestic Weighting), allowing for even further foresight.

### 5.Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system**
