#### 3. Inventory & Assets

- **Artifact:** "The Adrenaline Injector" (Temporarily boosts `['kinetic (energy)'(-ing) BPMS]` output at the cost of `['potential (energy)'(-ing) BPMS]` per `DECIDE-CORE-039`).
- **Skill:** "Combat Reflexes" (Bypasses the `['explicit layer'(-ing) BPMS]` to execute actions directly from the `['implicit layer'(-ing) BPMS]` per `DECIDE-CORE-020`).
- **Trait:** "Gut Feeling" (Provides visual warnings of danger based on `DECIDE-CORE-051` before the threat is visible).

#### 4. Symbiotic Evolution with Decision BPMS

- **Mechanism:** This artifact operates primarily on `DECIDE-CORE-034` (Bimodal Synchronization), locking the user into `Fast Mode` during combat. It actively suppresses "Analysis Paralysis" by filtering out complex UI elements when under threat.
- **Evolution:** Through `DECIDE-CORE-055` (Ecological Niche-Fitting), the artifact adapts to the specific biome it inhabits. If the user survives long enough in a "Snow" biome, the artifact evolves "Cold Resistance" and "Snow Camouflage" behaviors automatically.
