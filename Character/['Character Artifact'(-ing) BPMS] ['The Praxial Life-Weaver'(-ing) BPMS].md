## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial Life-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-LIFE-GENESIS-001`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial Life-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for agency, carrying stats, inventory, and local reality collapse, specifically tuned to instantiate and evolve the protocols of `[life(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "I" of the simulation), Symbiotic Evolution, Ecosystem Engineering.
- **Tag:** `#avatar #stats #inventory #identity #autopoiesis #symbiosis`

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** **Aelion, The Autopoietic Seed**
- **Age:** **[Cyclical/Renormalized]** (Reflecting `LIFE-CORE-039`: The Principle of Continuous Existence; age is a measure of current iteration, not linear time).
- **Role:** **Symbiotic Evolutionist / Vitality Anchor**
- **Essence:** Aelion is not merely a static character but a dynamic **System State** defined by `LIFE-CORE-001` (The Axiom of Vital Spark). They exist to actively maintain a gradient against entropy, transforming from "Object" to "Agent" through the **Autopoietic Loop**.
- **Narrative Function:** To act as the **Protagonist of Continuity** (`LIFE-CORE-015`), weaving meaning into the raw data of the simulation and driving the **Ecological Succession** (`LIFE-CORE-008`) of the world around them.

### 2. Attribute Matrix

*Attributes are derived directly from the functional necessities of `[life(-ing) BPMS]`.*

- **Autopoietic Integrity (Constitution):** **[Rank: S]**
  - *Definition:* The capacity for **Homeostatic Regulation** (`LIFE-CORE-006`) and **Systemic Closure** (`LIFE-CORE-026`).
  - *Function:* Maintains internal equilibrium (HP/Stamina) against external chaos. Enables the **Ouroboros Cycle** of self-repair and resource recycling.
- **Adaptive Morphology (Dexterity/Plasticity):** **[Rank: A]**
  - *Definition:* The speed and range of **Phenotypic Plasticity** (`LIFE-CORE-002`).
  - *Function:* Allows Aelion to dynamically restructure their form and stats in response to environmental stress (**The Stress-Response Curve**). "Form flows into function."
- **Symbiotic Resonance (Charisma/Connection):** **[Rank: S+]**
  - *Definition:* The power of **Symbiotic Networking** (`LIFE-CORE-005`) and **Universal Symbiosis** (`LIFE-CORE-042`).
  - *Function:* Enables the formation of **Metasystemic Hives** (`LIFE-CORE-012`) and allows Aelion to bond with *any* element of the framework (Physics, Logic, Magic) to create **Complex Emergence** (`LIFE-CORE-037`).
- **Praxial Cognition (Intelligence):** **[Rank: A]**
  - *Definition:* The depth of integration with the **Praxial Substrate** (`LIFE-CORE-014`).
  - *Function:* Utilizes the environment as an extended mind (**The Extended Mind** mechanism). Enables **Sentient Projection** (`LIFE-CORE-007`) to simulate and collapse future timelines.
- **Disruptive Agency (Strength/Will):** **[Rank: B]**
  - *Definition:* The capacity for **Initiative** and **Action** (`LIFE-CORE-010`).
  - *Function:* Generates the **Impulse** to disturb the peace and force the system to remain **Open**. Drives the **Frontier Algorithm** of **Adaptive Exploration** (`LIFE-CORE-023`).

### 3. Inventory & Assets

*Items are "Vivified" Atomic Facts (`LIFE-CORE-041`) that serve as tools for biological and systemic manipulation.*

- **Asset 1:** `['The Genetic Payload'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Seed**)
  - *Reference:* `LIFE-CORE-004` (The Axiom of Reproductive Continuity).
  - *Description:* A portable containment unit for the **Blueprint of Life**. It allows Aelion to copy their core logic and stats into new instances, ensuring **Information Persistence** beyond a single cycle. It contains the **Mutation Engine** for **Creative Mutagenesis** (`LIFE-CORE-009`).
- **Asset 2:** `['The Utility Lens'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Sensor**)
  - *Reference:* `LIFE-CORE-011` (The Law of Essential Value).
  - *Description:* An ocular implant or magical lens that overlays a **Value Heatmap** onto the world. It calculates **Utility** dynamically based on Aelion's current **Need State** (e.g., highlighting food when hungry, cover when threatened).
- **Asset 3:** `['The Mnestic Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Database**)
  - *Reference:* `LIFE-CORE-029` (The Axiom of Mnestic Consolidation).
  - *Description:* A **Consolidation Bridge** device. It buffers **Short-Term (Memory)** (Recent Events) and crystallizes them into **Long-Term (Memory)** (Skills/Wisdom) during rest cycles. It is the engine of **Learning** and **Leveling Up**.
- **Asset 4:** `['The Influence Field Generator'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Aura**)
  - *Reference:* `LIFE-CORE-036` (The Principle of Particle-Field Duality).
  - *Description:* A symbiotic organ that projects Aelion's **Presence** into the surrounding grid. It creates an **Influence Map** that modifies the behavior of other entities (e.g., Fear, Inspiration, Attraction) before physical contact is made.
- **Asset 5:** `['The Niche Constructor'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Tool**)
  - *Reference:* `LIFE-CORE-013` (The Principle of Niche Construction).
  - *Description:* A multi-tool designed for **World Building**. It allows Aelion to physically alter the environment (Dig, Build, Plant) to create new **Ecological Niches**, expanding the **Ecological Possibility** space for themselves and others.
