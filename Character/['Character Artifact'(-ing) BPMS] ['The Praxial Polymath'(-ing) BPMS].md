## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial Polymath'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `CHAR-INST-POLYMATH-001`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial Polymath'(-ing) BPMS]` (Alias: "The Evo-Vessel")
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Holonic Host']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['adaptive learner'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as a dynamic, evolving vessel that acquires, hosts, and orchestrates `['Praxial Skill Cell (PSC)'(-ing) BPMS]` to solve problems across any domain.
- **Scope of Application:** Cross-World Problem Solving, Skill Trading, Adaptive Gameplay.
- **Tag:** `#praxial-skill-cell #skill #polymath #skill_host #evolution #adaptive`

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** Cipher (Default) / User-Defined
- **Archetype:** The Blank Slate / The Blue Mage
- **Description:** Cipher is not a warrior, mage, or thief by default. Cipher is a **"Cellular Host."** Their body is a **`['Praxial Capability Fabric (PCF)'(-ing) BPMS]`** designed to integrate external knowledge. Unlike traditional characters who learn by "leveling up" abstract numbers, Cipher learns by **absorbing** `['Praxial Skill Cell (PSC)'(-ing) BPMS]`. If Cipher eats a "Swordsmanship Cell," they become a master fencer instantly. If they swap it for a "Quantum Physics Cell," they forget fencing and become a physicist.
- **Symbiotic Logic:** Cipher's identity is fluid. It is defined entirely by the **constellation of PSCs** currently active in their system. This implements **`[identity(-ing) BPMS]`** as a function of **`[competence(-ing) BPMS]`**.

### 2. Attribute Matrix (The Holonic Summation)

*Unlike standard RPGs, attributes here are not static integers. They are dynamic summations of the active Skill Cells.*

| Attribute Category             | Value Calculation                      | Active PSCs (Examples)                                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cognitive Processing (INT)** | `∑(Logic Cells + Knowledge Cells)`     | `[PSC-LOGIC-04: Bayesian Inference]`, `[PSC-KNOW-09: History of Rome]` |
| **Kinetic Output (STR/DEX)**   | `∑(Combat Cells + Movement Cells)`     | `[PSC-CBT-01: Krav Maga]`, `[PSC-MOVE-03: Parkour]`          |
| **Social Resonance (CHA)**     | `∑(Empathy Cells + Negotiation Cells)` | `[PSC-SOC-02: Diplomatic Protocol]`, `[PSC-PSYCH-01: Micro-Expression Reading]` |
| **Metabolic Capacity (CON)**   | `∑(Resource Management Cells)`         | `[PSC-META-05: Caloric Efficiency]`, `[PSC-REC-02: Rapid Recovery]` |

- Symbiotic Evolution Mechanism:
  - **Growth:** To increase Strength, the user must find and install a higher-tier `[Combat PSC]`.
  - **Atrophy:** If a PSC is unused for too long (per `PSC-MEM-025`), it enters "Dormancy," lowering the attribute.

### 3. Inventory & Assets (The Cellular Library)

*The Inventory does not just hold "items"; it holds **Living Functions** (PSCs) wrapped in Artifact Shells.*

#### **Slot A: The Active Nucleus (Equipped Skills)**

*These are the PSCs currently "running" in the character's RAM.*

1. **`[PSC-NAV-001] The Pathfinder's Compass`**
   - **Type:** `['Praxial Skill Cell'(-ing) BPMS]`
   - **Function:** `[PSC-NAV-001].execute(Target)`
   - **Description:** A navigational cell that overlays a "Golden Path" on the user's vision, guiding them to their objective.
   - **Symbiosis:** Consumes `[kinetic (energy)]` to generate `[system vector]`.
2. **`[PSC-LANG-007] The Universal Translator`**
   - **Type:** `['Praxial Skill Cell'(-ing) BPMS]`
   - **Function:** `[PSC-LANG-007].translate(Audio_Input)`
   - **Description:** A linguistic cell that intercepts incoming audio and rewrites it into the user's native language in real-time.
   - **Symbiosis:** Filters `[phenomenon]` to optimize `[experience]`.

#### **Slot B: The Dormant Mitochondria (Stored Potential)**

*These are PSCs carried in the inventory, ready to be swapped in.*

1. **`[PSC-CRAFT-012] The Matter Weaver`**
   - **Type:** `['Praxial Skill Cell'(-ing) BPMS]`
   - **State:** *Dormant (Crystallized)*
   - **Potential:** When equipped, allows the user to transmute raw `[food(-ing) BPMS]` into tools.
2. **`[PSC-ARCH-003] The Blueprint Eye`**
   - **Type:** `['Praxial Skill Cell'(-ing) BPMS]`
   - **State:** *Dormant*
   - **Potential:** Allows the user to see the structural integrity and weak points of buildings.

### 4. Symbiotic Evolution Mechanics (The Evo-Loop)

*This section defines how this Character Artifact evolves via the PSCs.*

- **Absorption (The Learning):** When Cipher encounters a new problem (e.g., a locked door) and lacks the skill, they can "purchase" or "loot" a `[Lockpicking PSC]`. Installing it permanently adds that function to their repertoire.
- **Synthesis (The Innovation):** If Cipher holds both `[PSC-FIRE-01: Pyromancy]` and `[PSC-SWORD-01: Fencing]`, the **`['Praxial Skill Cell (PSC)'(-ing) BPMS]`** logic (`PSC-HOLO-014`) allows them to merge into a new **Hybrid Cell**: `[PSC-HYBRID-01: Flaming Sword Style]`.
- **Exaptation (The Adaptation):** Per `PSC-NICHE-012`, if Cipher takes a `[Cooking PSC]` into a "Combat World," the character might evolve the skill to "Cook Enemies" or "Buff Allies," finding a new niche for the old skill.

### 5.Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system**
