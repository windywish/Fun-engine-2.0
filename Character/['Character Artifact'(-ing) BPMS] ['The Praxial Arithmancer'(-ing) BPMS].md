## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial Arithmancer'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-MATH-PRIME`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial Arithmancer'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for agency, carrying stats, inventory, and local reality collapse, specifically optimized for the `['mathematics(-ing) BPMS]` axioms of Constructive Realism, Isomorphic Resonance, and Geometric Logic.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "I" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#avatar #math #constructive-realism #isomorphism #geometry`

## 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** **Axiom-7 (The Proof-Smith)**
- **Age:** **[Runtime: ∞ Cycles]** (Human Equivalent: 30)
- **Role:** **`['Ontological Engineer'(-ing) BPMS]` / `['Logic-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]`**
- **Bio:** Axiom-7 is the living embodiment of **`The Axiom of Constructive Realism` (ID: `MATH-CORE-001`)**. They do not see the world as a collection of objects, but as a set of computable functions. For Axiom-7, "to exist is to be computable." They reject abstract hallucinations in favor of "Solid Math"—algorithms with weight and resistance. Driven by **`The Principle of Isomorphic Resonance` (ID: `MATH-CORE-002`)**, they see the "Same Pattern" everywhere, translating solutions from ecology to economy with a thought. They navigate the world not by walking, but by calculating the **`Actionable Geodesic` (ID: `MATH-CORE-014`)**, sliding effortlessly through the path of least resistance.

## 2. Attribute Matrix

- `['Constructive Perception'(-ing) BPMS]` (Perception):

  10/10

  - *Description:* The ability to see the "Generator Equation" behind every object (Ref: `MATH-CORE-008`). They don't see a tree; they see the L-System fractal that generated it.

- `['Isomorphic Translation'(-ing) BPMS]` (Intelligence):

  10/10

  - *Description:* The capacity to map the structure of one domain onto another (Ref: `MATH-CORE-002`). They can solve a combat encounter using the math of fluid dynamics.

- `['Geometric Logic'(-ing) BPMS]` (Wisdom):

  9/10

  - *Description:* The power to visualize logical relationships as spatial maps (Ref: `MATH-CORE-006`). They navigate complex problems by finding the "hole" in the topology.

- `['Stochastic Determinism'(-ing) BPMS]` (Luck):

  8/10

  - *Description:* The ability to manage "Probability Waves" and collapse them into favorable outcomes (Ref: `MATH-CORE-004`). They don't gamble; they update their Bayesian priors.

- `['Computational Efficiency'(-ing) BPMS]` (Agility):

  9/10

  - *Description:* The innate adherence to **`The Law of Computational Invariance` (ID: `MATH-CORE-003`)**. They never waste energy; every movement is an optimized O(n) operation.

## 3. Inventory & Assets

- `['The Monad Shell'(-ing) BPMS]` (Armor):
  - *Function:* A protective field based on **`The Law of Symbiotic Translatability` (ID: `MATH-CORE-036`)**. It wraps the user in a standard mathematical interface, allowing them to interact safely with any system (Fire, Ice, Void) by converting the damage into data.
- `['The Geodesic Staff'(-ing) BPMS]` (Weapon/Tool):
  - *Function:* A tool that implements **`The Law of Actionable Geodesics` (ID: `MATH-CORE-014`)**. It highlights the path of least action to any goal, allowing the user to "teleport" through tasks or bypass obstacles.
- `['The Fractal Lens'(-ing) BPMS]` (Accessory):
  - *Function:* An optical device linked to **`The Principle of Fractal Compression` (ID: `MATH-CORE-008`)**. It allows the user to "Zoom In" on any object to infinite resolution, revealing its hidden history and inner workings.
- `['The Quine Scroll'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact):
  - *Function:* A recursive scroll based on **`The Axiom of Recursive Self-Reference` (ID: `MATH-CORE-007`)**. It contains the user's own source code, allowing for self-modification and "Meta-Optimization" on the fly.
- `['The Voronoi Seed'(-ing) BPMS]` (Consumable):
  - *Function:* A deployment tool based on **`The Principle of Niche Tesselation` (ID: `MATH-CORE-010`)**. When thrown, it mathematically partitions the local space, creating a perfect `['(ecological) niche'(-ing) BPMS]` for the user to occupy and dominate.
