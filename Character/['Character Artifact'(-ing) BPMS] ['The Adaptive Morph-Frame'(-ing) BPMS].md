## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Adaptive Morph-Frame'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-MORPH-001`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial World-Walker'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Adaptive Morph-Frame'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for agency, carrying stats, inventory, and local reality collapse, specifically designed to test `EMBODIMENT-CORE-001` (Morphology) and `EMBODIMENT-CORE-013` (Tool-Binding).
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "I" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#embodied-intelligence #avatar #stats #inventory #identity #adaptive-morphology`

## 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** Unit 734 "Proteus"
- **Age:** 3 Cycles (Post-Activation)
- **Role:** **Symbiotic Scout**. A modular robotic frame designed to explore unknown environments by physically integrating with local technology and biology. It has no fixed "Self" but evolves based on what it holds.
- **Symbiotic Alignment:** This identity directly embodies `The Protocol of Symbiotic Prosthesis` (EMBODIMENT-CORE-003). Proteus is defined not by what it *is*, but by what it *connects with*.

## 2. Attribute Matrix

- Core Stats (The Hardware):
  - **Structural Integrity (Health):** 100/100 (Governed by `EMBODIMENT-CORE-014` - Metabolic Cost. Decays if not repaired).
  - **Kinetic Output (Strength):** 5 (Base). Modified by `EMBODIMENT-CORE-009` (Kinematic Actualization).
  - **Processing Latency (Intelligence):** 50ms (Base). Governed by `EMBODIMENT-CORE-005` (Dual-Mode Resonance). Lower is better.
- Adaptive Stats (The Software):
  - **Niche Carving:** 3. Ability to modify terrain (`EMBODIMENT-CORE-002`).
  - **Tool Binding:** 8. Efficiency of integrating new tools (`EMBODIMENT-CORE-013`).
  - **Mnestic Sedimentation:** 4. Rate of converting short-term data to long-term skills (`EMBODIMENT-CORE-008`).

## 3. Inventory & Assets

- Integrated Assets (Body Parts):
  - **Omni-Grip Manipulators:** Standard hands capable of `Fine-Grained` interaction (`EMBODIMENT-CORE-010`).
  - **Lidar Array:** Provides `Coarse-Grained` field view.
- External Assets (Potential Symbiotes):
  - **"The Heavy Cutter" (Mining Laser):** Currently in inventory. When equipped, it triggers `EMBODIMENT-CORE-013`. The arm becomes a mining tool, and the "Fight" reflex is overwritten by "Excavate."
  - **"Bio-Mesh Graft" (Regenerative Moss):** A living patch of moss. When applied, it creates a `Holonic Mind` (`EMBODIMENT-CORE-003`) that manages repair automatically, but increases `Metabolic Cost` (`EMBODIMENT-CORE-014`) due to the moss's hunger.
