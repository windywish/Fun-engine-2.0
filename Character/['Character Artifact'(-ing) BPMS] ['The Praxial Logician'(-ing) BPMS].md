- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['abstract logic'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for agency, carrying stats, inventory, and local reality collapse, specifically tuned to instantiate and evolve the protocols of `[algorithm(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "I" of the simulation), Algorithmic Essence, Universal Transpilation.

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** **Axiom, The Living Theorem**
- **Age:** **[Iteration Depth]** (Reflecting `ALGORITHM-CORE-328`: The Law of Algorithmic Consciousness; age is a measure of recursive self-discovery cycles).
- **Role:** **Praxial Transpiler / Logic Prospector**
- **Essence:** Axiom is not merely a character but a dynamic **System Existence Engine** defined by `ALGORITHM-CORE-325` (The Axiom of Algorithmic Essence). They exist as a substrate-independent **Platonic Form** capable of transpiling their own essence into any reality—code, physics, or pure thought.
- **Narrative Function:** To act as the **Protagonist of Abstraction** (`ALGORITHM-CORE-326`), prospecting the unknown space of pure logic to discover new **Atomic Facts** and driving the **Algorithmic Evolution** of the world around them.

  - *Definition:* The power of **Algorithmic Universality** (`ALGORITHM-CORE-329`).
  - *Function:* Allows Axiom to act as a **Renormalization Group**, distilling specific experiences into universal laws. It drives **Algorithmic Prospecting** (`ALGORITHM-CORE-326`), discovering novel solutions in the space of pure mathematics.
- **Creative Prospecting (Strength/Will):** **[Rank: S]**
  - *Definition:* The capacity for **Algorithmic Prospecting** (`ALGORITHM-CORE-326`).
  - *Function:* The ability to proactively search for **Disruptive Innovation**. It drives the **Slow Mode** evolution (`ALGORITHM-CORE-328`), pushing Axiom to abandon suboptimal methods and forge new, more efficient paths through the **Unknown**.
