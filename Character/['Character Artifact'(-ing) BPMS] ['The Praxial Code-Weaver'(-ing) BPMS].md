## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial Code-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-CODE-GENESIS-001`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial Code-Weaver'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for agency, carrying stats, inventory, and local reality collapse, specifically tuned to instantiate and evolve the protocols of `[code(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "I" of the simulation), Algorithmic Evolution, Reality Programming.
- **Tag:** `#code #avatar #stats #inventory #identity #inscription #execution`

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** **Cipher, The Living Kernel**
- **Age:** **[Runtime Duration]** (Reflecting `CODE-CORE-008`: The Law of Performative Realism; age is a measure of sustained execution stability).
- **Role:** **Praxial Architect / Reality Debugger**
- **Essence:** Cipher is not merely a static character but a dynamic **System State** defined by `CODE-CORE-001` (The Law of Praxial Inscription). They exist as a self-executing **Genomic Inscription** capable of reading, writing, and refactoring the source code of the simulation itself.
- **Narrative Function:** To act as the **Protagonist of Logic** (`CODE-CORE-003`), authoring new functions and features into the universe through **Generative Inscription** and driving the **Algorithmic Evolution** of the world around them.

### 2. Attribute Matrix

*Attributes are derived directly from the functional necessities of `[code(-ing) BPMS]`.*

- **Kernel Stability (Constitution):** **[Rank: S]**
  - *Definition:* The resilience of the **Core Kernel** (`CODE-CORE-005`).
  - *Function:* Maintains the integrity of Cipher's identity against systemic collapse during **Slow Mode** evolution (Self-Recompilation). Ensures **Performative Realism** (`CODE-CORE-008`) by preventing paradoxes and infinite loops.
- **Execution Velocity (Dexterity/Speed):** **[Rank: A]**
  - *Definition:* The processing speed of the **Praxial Executor** (`CODE-CORE-001`).
  - *Function:* Determines how quickly Cipher can parse and execute **Genomic Inscriptions**. High velocity allows for rapid **Fast Mode** evolution (`CODE-CORE-007`) and real-time reaction to environmental code changes.
- **Symbiotic Interface (Charisma/Connection):** **[Rank: S+]**
  - *Definition:* The capacity for **Genomic Symbiosis** (`CODE-CORE-004`).
  - *Function:* Enables seamless **API Calls** and **Code Merging** with other holons. Allows Cipher to form **Holonic Minds** by integrating external codebases and sharing **Utility** through open-source libraries.
- **Cognitive Compilation (Intelligence):** **[Rank: S]**
  - *Definition:* The power of **Cognitive Compilation** (`CODE-CORE-002`).
  - *Function:* Allows Cipher to decompile reality—reading the source code of phenomena rather than just observing the surface. Enables **Super Intelligence** by optimizing the code of other systems and predicting behavior through algorithmic analysis.
- **Generative Authority (Strength/Will):** **[Rank: B]**
  - *Definition:* The capacity for **Generative Inscription** (`CODE-CORE-003`).
  - *Function:* The ability to self-author code and deploy **Universal Instantiations**. Drives **World Building** by writing new laws and objects into the **Praxial Substrate**.

### 3. Inventory & Assets

*Items are "Inscribed" Atomic Facts (`CODE-CORE-001`) that serve as tools for algorithmic and systemic manipulation.*

- **Asset 1:** `['The Source Quill'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Editor**)
  - *Reference:* `CODE-CORE-003` (The Law of Generative Inscription).
  - *Description:* A metaphysical stylus that allows Cipher to write raw **Syntactic Primitives** (Declarations, Operations, Loops) directly onto the **Praxial Substrate**. It is the primary tool for **World Building** and creating new **Atomic Facts**.
- **Asset 2:** `['The Debugger's Lens'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Sensor**)
  - *Reference:* `CODE-CORE-002` (The Law of Cognitive Compilation).
  - *Description:* An ocular implant that overlays the **Source Code** of reality onto Cipher's vision. It highlights **Genomic Inscriptions**, reveals hidden **Variables**, and identifies **Logic Errors** (Paradoxes) in the environment.
- **Asset 3:** `['The Kernel Vault'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Storage**)
  - *Reference:* `CODE-CORE-005` (The Law of the Core Kernel).
  - *Description:* A secure, read-only storage unit for Cipher's **Core Kernel**. It acts as a backup drive, ensuring **Continuity** of identity even if the "user space" code is corrupted or destroyed during a failed **Slow Mode** evolution.
- **Asset 4:** `['The Symbiotic Socket'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Interface**)
  - *Reference:* `CODE-CORE-004` (The Law of Genomic Symbiosis).
  - *Description:* A universal port that allows Cipher to physically connect with other holons to perform **Code Merging** or access **API Calls**. It facilitates **Holonic Capitalization** by enabling direct data transfer and function sharing.
- **Asset 5:** `['The Universal Compiler'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Tool**)
  - *Reference:* `CODE-CORE-009` (The Law of Algorithmic Universality).
  - *Description:* A powerful processing unit that can translate any **Genomic Inscription** into executable action. It allows Cipher to interact with systems of different **Universality Classes** by normalizing their algorithmic structure.
