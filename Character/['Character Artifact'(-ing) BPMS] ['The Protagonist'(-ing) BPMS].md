#### 1. Identity Profile

**Name:** "The Weaver" **Role:** Diplomat / Storyteller **Core Philosophy:** "The story must go on." (Aligns with `DECIDE-CORE-009` & `DECIDE-CORE-053`)

#### 2. Attribute Matrix

- **Charisma (Field Modulation):** 10/10 (High capacity to alter the `[field (-ing) BPMS]` per `DECIDE-CORE-045`)
- **Empathy (Social Contract):** 9/10 (Deep integration with `DECIDE-CORE-056`)
- **Dramatic Intuition:** 8/10 (Biased towards `DECIDE-CORE-009` Narrative Resonance)
- **Combat Efficiency:** 3/10 (Suboptimal in pure kinetic conflict)

#### 3. Inventory & Assets

- **Artifact:** "The Mask of Many Faces" (Allows the user to swap `Contextual Modulation` matrices per `DECIDE-CORE-004`, adapting their personality to the social setting).
- **Skill:** "Silver Tongue" (Uses `DECIDE-CORE-027` Vectorial Commitment to override NPC decision vectors through social force).
- **Trait:** "Tragic Flaw" (Intentionally lowers `Utility` for decisions that are "Boring," forcing the user towards dramatic, high-risk choices per `DECIDE-CORE-053`).

#### 4. Symbiotic Evolution with Decision BPMS

- **Mechanism:** This artifact uses `DECIDE-CORE-016` (Semantic Continuity) to track the user's "Character Arc." It rewards decisions that are consistent with the established persona (e.g., a "Hero" sacrificing reward) and penalizes "Out of Character" actions.
- **Evolution:** As the user makes choices, the `DECIDE-CORE-007` (Symbiotic Value Transduction) mechanism calcifies these choices into permanent "Reputation Traits" (e.g., "Honest," "Ruthless"), which then open or close future narrative branches.
