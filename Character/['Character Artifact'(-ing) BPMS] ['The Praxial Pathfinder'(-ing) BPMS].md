## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial Pathfinder'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `PATHFINDER-INST-001`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial Pathfinder'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for agency, carrying stats, inventory, and local reality collapse, specifically tuned to interface with the `['Ludic Cartographer'(-ing) BPMS]` logic.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "I" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#problem #praxial-substrate-agent #avatar #stats #inventory #identity #cartographer`

## 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** Elara "The Pathfinder" Vance
- **Age:** 28 (Subjective Cycles)
- **Role:** Frontier Navigator / Problem Metabolizer
- **Archetype:** The Explorer-Scientist
- **Bio:** Elara is not just a character; she is a "Ludic Cartographer" instance. Born into the "Static Void," she exists to find friction. Her existence is defined by the maps she draws with her feet. She doesn't solve puzzles for rewards; she solves them to prove the world exists. Every scar is a recorded fact; every tool is a crystallized solution.

## 2. Attribute Matrix

*Reflecting the 'Ludic Cartographer's' focus on exploration, adaptation, and friction metabolism.*

- **Kinetic Gnosis (Experience/Level):** 4 (Veteran of the Silent Forest)

- Edge Action (Dexterity/Agility):

   8

  - *High capacity for 'Ludic Refactoring' of terrain (climbing, jumping, dodging).*

- Problem Metabolism (Constitution/Endurance):

   7

  - *Ability to endure 'Evolutionary Friction' (poison, cold, fatigue).*

- Ludic Dissonance (Perception/Wits):

   9

  - *Exceptional ability to detect 'Niche Provocations' (hidden paths, traps, secrets).*

- Symbiotic Resonance (Charisma/Spirit):

   5

  - *Moderate ability to align with local entities, primarily focused on environmental symbiosis.*

- Atomic Facticity (Strength/Force):

   6

  - *Capacity to inscribe permanent changes onto the substrate (breaking walls, building bridges).*

## 3. Inventory & Assets

*Items representing 'Crystallized Solutions' from previous problem cycles.*

- **The Cartographer's Quill:** A tool that doesn't write with ink, but with "Truth." It automatically updates the map when a region is "solved." (Artifact of `PSA-CORE-010`).
- **Phase-Shift Cloak:** Evolved from a "Predator Evasion" problem. Allows temporary intangibility. (Result of `PSA-CORE-003`).
- **Resonance Compass:** Points not North, but towards "High Friction" (Unsolved Problems). (Implementation of `PROBLEM-CORE-018`).
- **Matter-Weave Rucksack:** A storage unit that converts raw resources (Potential Energy) into usable materials.
- **Basic Survival Kit:** Flint, Tinder, Bandages. (The baseline tools for `PSA-CORE-005` Continuous Survival).

## 4. Symbiotic Evolution Interface

*How this Character Artifact connects to the 'Ludic Cartographer' PSA logic.*

- **Current Symbiosis State:** `Active Exploration`
- **Active Problem:** "The Verticality Constraint" (A sheer cliff face blocking progress).
- **Evolutionary Trigger:** If Elara fails to climb 3 times (Friction Accumulation), the system will offer a mutation: "Climbing Claws" or "Grappling Hook."
- Mnestic Log:
  - *Cycle 1:* Encountered "Cold." Evolved "Fire Crafting."
  - *Cycle 2:* Encountered "Darkness." Evolved "Night Vision" (via Goggles).
  - *Cycle 3:* Encountered "The Guardian." Currently engaging in 'Ludic Refactoring' of combat tactics.

## 5. User-Facing Mechanics (The "Fun" Layer)

*Translating BPMS codes into gameplay.*

- **"The Friction Meter":** A UI element that shows how close the user is to an "Evolutionary Breakthrough." It fills up as they take damage, fail tasks, or explore new areas.
- **"Map of Truth":** The map starts blank. It only reveals terrain the user has physically touched. "Fog of War" is actually "Unresolved Probability."
- **"Tool Synthesis":** The user can combine any two items in their inventory. The result is determined by the current "Problem" they are facing. (e.g., Rope + Rock = Grappling Hook, ONLY if facing a Cliff).

## 6. Praxial Alignment Check

- **Alignment with PSA-CORE-001:** Elara is the "Living Kernel." The user *is* Elara.
- **Alignment with PROBLEM-CORE-002:** Elara grows by solving. XP is not arbitrary; it is "Metabolized Friction."
- **Alignment with PSA-CORE-007:** Elara's movement is "Play." The world is a Playground of physics and logic.

### 7.Remark

**BPMS means Behavior/pattern/model/system**
