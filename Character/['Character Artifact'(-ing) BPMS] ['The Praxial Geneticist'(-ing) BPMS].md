### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** **Helix, The Living Code**
- **Age:** **[Generation Count]** (Reflecting `GENE-CORE-044`: The Principle of The Immortal Germline; age is a measure of successful replication cycles).
- **Role:** **Praxial Splicer / Evolutionary Architect**
- **Essence:** Helix is not merely a biological entity but a dynamic **System Existence Engine** defined by `GENE-CORE-001` (The Axiom of Atomic Instruction). They exist as a self-contained **Genomic Library** capable of reading, writing, and executing the **Atomic Instructions** of life itself.
- **Narrative Function:** To act as the **Protagonist of Evolution** (`GENE-CORE-017`), driving the **Creative Mutation** of the world around them and exploring the **Combinatorial Space** (`GENE-CORE-002`) of potential forms.

### 2. Attribute Matrix

*Attributes are derived directly from the functional necessities of `[gene(-ing) BPMS]`.*

- **Genetic Stability (Constitution):** **[Rank: S]**
  - *Definition:* The resilience of the **Immortal Germline** (`GENE-CORE-044`).
  - *Function:* Maintains the integrity of Helix's **Atomic Instructions** against **Genetic Entropy** (`GENE-CORE-008`). Ensures **Systemic Continuity** (`GENE-CORE-022`) by preserving the core narrative of the species across generations.

- **Symbiotic Resonance (Charisma/Connection):** **[Rank: S+]**
  - *Definition:* The capacity for **Symbiotic Horizontal Transfer** (`GENE-CORE-010`).
  - *Function:* Enables Helix to exchange **Atomic Facts** with other entities via **The Plasmid Swap**. It facilitates **Symbiotic Openness** (`GENE-CORE-023`), allowing for the integration of external code and the formation of **Holobionts**.
- **Evolutionary Logic (Intelligence):** **[Rank: A+]**
  - *Definition:* The power of **Praxial Cognition** (`GENE-CORE-021`).
  - *Function:* Allows Helix to optimize **Genetic Algorithmics** (`GENE-CORE-013`), treating survival problems as search algorithms. It drives **Utility Valuation** (`GENE-CORE-018`), efficiently pruning useless traits to maximize **Essence**.
- **Niche Construction (Strength/Will):** **[Rank: A]**
  - *Definition:* The capacity for **Ecological World Building** (`GENE-CORE-020`).
  - *Function:* The ability to modify the **System Matrix** to create favorable **Ecological Niches**. It drives **The Law of Niche Construction** (`GENE-CORE-036`), ensuring that Helix shapes the world that shapes them.

### 3. Inventory & Assets

*Items are "Genetic" Atomic Facts (`GENE-CORE-001`) that serve as tools for biological and systemic manipulation.*

- **Asset 1:** `['The Codon Splicer'(-ing) BPMS]` (Artifact Class: **Tool**)
  - *Reference:* `GENE-CORE-002` (The Principle of Combinatorial Space).
  - *Description:* A molecular editing tool that allows Helix to perform **Recombination** on any biological entity. It can swap **Atomic Instructions** to create new hybrids or repair damaged code.
