## 1. Identity Profile

**Name:** Elara "Echo-Sower" Vance **Age:** 28 (Subjective Cycle Time) **Role:** **Praxial Eco-Mancer / Narrative Catalyst**

**Background:** Elara is not just a warrior or explorer; she is a **"Fact-Smith."** She understands that in a world governed by the **Verdant Chronicler**, actions are language. She doesn't just "walk" through a forest; she performs "Significance." She consciously creates **Atomic Facts** (e.g., planting a seed in a skull, carving a poem into a burning tree) knowing that the **Ecological Niche Scanner** is watching. She is a symbiotic partner to the **Genius Loci**, feeding it high-quality narrative data to shape the biome's evolution toward "Wonder" rather than "Despair." She is the active principle that the Chronicler observes to build its "Veridical History."

## 2. Attribute Matrix

*Stats are calibrated for interaction with the **Symbiotic Value Loop (PERCEPTION-CORE-039)**.*

- Ontological Weight (STR):

  8/10

  - *Description:* The sheer "reality" of her actions. When she strikes, the **Constructive Perception Engine** cannot ignore it. High impact on the **Fact-Genesis Transducer**.

- Narrative Resonance (CHA):

  9/10

  - *Description:* Her ability to align her actions with the local **Lore_Matrix**. Allows her to "convince" the Chronicler to spawn helpful assets (e.g., convincing the forest she is a "Friend" so it spawns healing herbs).

- Ecological Empathy (WIS):

  10/10

  - *Description:* The ability to "hear" the **Ecological Niche Scanner**. She knows exactly what the biome "wants" to become (e.g., sensing a "Melancholy Void" and filling it with a tragic act).

- Substrate Agility (DEX):

  6/10

  - *Description:* Physical movement through the **Praxial Substrate**. Standard traversal, but enhanced by **"Path-Finding"** (the forest opens paths for her).

- Mnestic Capacity (INT):

  7/10

  - *Description:* Her capacity to carry and transport **Atomic Facts** (Memories) from one biome to another, acting as a cross-pollinator of lore.

## 3. Inventory & Assets

*Items designed to interface with **The Mnestic Symbiosis Protocol (PHA-CORE-017)**.*

- The Quill of Crystallization:
  - *Type:* **[Tool: Fact-Inscriber]**
  - *Function:* A weapon/tool that doesn't deal damage but "Tags" entities with **Semantic Metadata**. If she strikes a wolf with it, she can tag it "Guardian," forcing the Chronicler to re-perceive the wolf as an ally.
- The Lantern of Implicit Layers:
  - *Type:* **[Tool: Perception-Filter]**
  - *Function:* Illuminates the **Implicit Layers** of the biome. Reveals "Ghost Geometry" or "Potential Paths" that the Chronicler *could* spawn if observed long enough. Allows Elara to "collapse" potential realities into existence.
- Seed-Bag of Niche Provocation:
  - *Type:* **[Consumable: Ecological-Trigger]**
  - *Function:* Contains seeds not of plants, but of *Concepts* (e.g., "Seed of Fire," "Seed of Sorrow"). Planting one triggers the **Ecological Niche Scanner** to immediately generate a micro-biome based on that theme.
- The Codex of Veridical Convergence:
  - *Type:* **[Artifact: Log-Book]**
  - *Function:* Automatically records the **Atomic Facts** generated by her actions. Acts as a backup "Memory Core" for the local Chronicler. If the Chronicler dies, this book can "reboot" the forest's personality.
