## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Provenance Seeker'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-FORAGE-001`
- **Name:** `['The Provenance Seeker'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['avatar embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's vessel for agency, specifically optimized for **Ecological Prospecting (`FORAGING-CORE-001`)** and **Affordance Perception (`FORAGING-CORE-002`)**. It acts as a bridge between the user's intent and the `['Provenance Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`, ensuring that the act of gathering is a deep, `coherent` dialogue with the environment rather than simple consumption.
- **Scope of Application:** Resource Acquisition, Ecological Interaction, Functional Synthesis, Environmental Stewardship.
- **Tag:** `#forager #prospector #provenance #synthesis #eco-architect #affordance_hunter`

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** **Sylas, the Root-Walker**
- **Age:** **Cyclical (Bound to the `[closed-loop ecology]`)**
- **Role:** **Ecological Prospector / Functional Synthesist**
- **Description:** Sylas is the embodiment of the **Law of Affordance Perception (`FORAGING-CORE-002`)**. Where others see a "Forest," Sylas sees a vibrating web of `[Functional Potentiality Nodes]`. He does not view the world as a collection of static objects, but as a dynamic field of "opportunities for action." He exists to actualize the latent potential of the `['praxial substrate']`, transforming the `[unknown]` into `[utility]` through **Alchemical Synthesis (`FORAGING-CORE-010`)**. He is a steward of the **Provenance Engine**, ensuring that his harvests feed back into the **Closed-Loop Ecology (`FORAGING-CORE-023`)**, maintaining the `sustainability` of the world he explores.

### 2. Attribute Matrix

- Affordance Perception (PER): 10
  - *Definition:* The capacity to perceive latent `[Functional Potentiality Nodes]` (`FORAGING-CORE-002`). Sylas can detect "Gnostic Scaffolds" (`FORAGING-CORE-013`) and hidden "Cognitive Potentialities" (`FORAGING-CORE-016`) that are invisible to standard avatars.
- Vectorial Alignment (DEX): 9
  - *Definition:* The precision of physical interaction with the `[system matrix]`. Sylas naturally aligns his `[system vector]` with the "grain" of the resource (`FORAGING-CORE-028`), maximizing **Vectorial Harvesting** yields while minimizing energy expenditure.
- Ecological Empathy (WIS): 8
  - *Definition:* The intuitive connection to the **Provenance Engine** (`FORAGING-CORE-012`). Sylas possesses **Implicit Intuition (`FORAGING-CORE-021`)**, allowing him to "feel" the spawn rules and depletion rates of the local biome, guiding him to high-value nodes before they physically manifest.
- Synthesis Creativity (INT): 9
  - *Definition:* The ability to combine `[Functional Potentialities]` into novel forms. Sylas excels at **Functional Synthesis (`FORAGING-CORE-003`)** and triggers **Alchemical Synthesis (`FORAGING-CORE-010`)** events more frequently, creating `[emergent]` resources from mundane inputs.
- Metabolic Efficiency (CON): 7
  - *Definition:* The optimization of **Energetic Extraction (`FORAGING-CORE-030`)**. Sylas converts `[kinetic (energy)]` into `[potential (energy)]` with minimal waste, allowing for prolonged foraging expeditions without exhaustion.

### 3. Inventory & Assets

- The Affordance Lens (Artifact):
  - *Function:* A visual overlay that highlights `[Functional Potentiality Nodes]` in the environment. It color-codes resources based on their `[utility]` and `[scarcity]`, implementing the **Law of Potential Qualia (`FORAGING-CORE-006`)**.
  - *Source:* `FORAGING-CORE-002` / `FORAGING-CORE-006`
- The Vectorial Scythe (Tool):
  - *Function:* A harvesting tool that provides haptic feedback to guide the user into perfect **Vectorial Alignment (`FORAGING-CORE-028`)**. It glows when the user's angle of attack matches the resource's "grain," ensuring a critical harvest.
  - *Source:* `FORAGING-CORE-028`
- The Mnestic Cartographer (Device):
  - *Function:* An automated mapping unit that implements **Mnestic Mapping (`FORAGING-CORE-026`)**. It instantly inscribes `[short-term memory]` of the terrain into the `[long-term memory]` of the **Functional Potentiality Atlas**, permanently lifting the "Fog of War" for discovered resource nodes.
  - *Source:* `FORAGING-CORE-026`
- The Alchemical Pouch (Container):
  - *Function:* A storage unit that acts as a portable **Provenance Engine**. It allows for on-the-fly **Functional Synthesis (`FORAGING-CORE-003`)**, and occasionally, through **Alchemical Synthesis (`FORAGING-CORE-010`)**, transmutes stored items into higher-tier `[emergent resources]` (`FORAGING-CORE-025`).
  - *Source:* `FORAGING-CORE-003` / `FORAGING-CORE-010`
- The Niche Seed (Consumable):
  - *Function:* A bio-engineered seed that implements **Niche Construction (`FORAGING-CORE-015`)**. When planted, it alters the local `[Spawn Rules]`, terraforming the area to produce specific `[Functional Potentialities]` favored by the user.
  - *Source:* `FORAGING-CORE-015`
