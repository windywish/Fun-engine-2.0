## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The User-Observer'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `CHAR-BIO-001`
- **Name:** `['The User-Observer'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Origin/Implementer(Parent instance):** `['human-computer interaction'(-ing) BPMS]:['Praxial Interface Engine'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Avatar Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['nano-scale telepresence avatar'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the user's embodied vessel within the molecular simulation, carrying the "Divine Authority" to override physics, the "Haptic Hands" to manipulate atoms, and the "Cognitive Lens" to perceive invisible forces.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency, Molecular Manipulation, Human-in-the-Loop Training.
- **Tag:** `#human-computer-interaction #praxial-interface-engine #avatar #nano-operator #haptic-hand #divine-intervention`

## 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** The Operator / The Chaperone-Pilot
- **Role:** **Deus Ex Machina**. The user is not a passive scientist but an active participant—a "God from the Machine" who descends into the simulation to fix what the automated physics engine cannot.
- **Scale:** Variable. The avatar exists at a "Renormalized Scale" where 1 Angstrom = 10cm. To the protein, the user is a Titan; to the user, the protein is a complex puzzle toy.
- **Phenomenology:** The user experiences the simulation not as data, but as **Physical Resistance**. The avatar's "Body" is a set of force-fields that interact with the atomic lattice.

## 2. Attribute Matrix (The "Divine Stats")

- Strength (Force Injection):

  Variable (10 pN - 1 nN)

  .

  - *Low:* Gentle nudges to guide side-chains (Thermal fluctuation level).
  - *High:* "God Mode" pulling to untie knots or rip apart beta-sheets (Covalent bond breaking level).

- Precision (Spatial Resolution):

  0.1 Angstroms

  .

  - The avatar's "fingertips" are sharpened force-fields capable of selecting individual atoms within a crowded cluster.

- Perception (Field Vision):

  Multi-Spectral

  .

  - *Electrostatic Sight:* Sees charge gradients as color (Red/Blue).
  - *Hydrophobic Sight:* Sees "oily" patches as sticky textures.
  - *Entropy Sight:* Sees high-energy/unstable regions as vibrating "Heat Haze."

- Chronokinesis (Time Control):

  0 - 100x

  .

  - *Freeze:* Stop all thermal noise to inspect structure.
  - *Slow-Mo:* Watch a folding event in detail.
  - *Fast-Forward:* Skip the boring equilibration phases.

## 3. Inventory & Assets (The "Toolbelt")

- The Haptic Gauntlets (Primary Weapon):
  - *Function:* Transmits force from user to atom and resistance from atom to user.
  - *Mode A (Tweezers):* Precision manipulation of single atoms.
  - *Mode B (Field Generator):* Emits a repulsive/attractive sphere to push/pull groups of atoms.
- The Energy Lens (HUD):
  - *Function:* An Augmented Reality overlay that displays real-time ΔG (Gibbs Free Energy).
  - *Asset:* **"The Gradient Arrow"** - A visual guide pointing "Downhill" on the energy landscape, showing the user the path of least resistance.
- The Anchor Spike:
  - *Function:* A virtual tool that "Pins" an atom in space (Infinite Mass), holding it still while the user manipulates the rest of the chain around it.
- The Divine Log (Memory Crystal):
  - *Function:* Automatically records every successful intervention.
  - *Asset:* **"The Golden Trace"** - A saved trajectory of a successful fold that can be replayed or fed into the AI for training.

## 4. Symbiotic Evolution Logic (The "Level Up")

- **Initial State:** **Observer Mode**. User can fly around and see fields but has weak interaction force (cannot break bonds).

- **Evolution Trigger:** User successfully unties 10 "Kinetic Traps" (knots) that the AI failed to solve.

- Evolution Stage 1:

  Interventionist Mode

  .

  - *Unlock:* **"Bond Breaker"**. Strength increases. User can now temporarily break non-covalent bonds (H-bonds) to reset a fold.
  - *Unlock:* **"Chronokinesis"**. User gains the ability to pause/rewind the simulation.

- **Evolution Trigger:** User guides a protein to a "New Native State" (lower energy than the known structure).

- Evolution Stage 2:

  Architect Mode

  .

  - *Unlock:* **"Mutator Beam"**. User can instantly change an amino acid type (e.g., turn Glycine to Tryptophan) to see how it affects the fold in real-time.
  - *Unlock:* **"God Hands"**. User can grab multiple parts of the chain simultaneously (using multi-point selection) to perform complex folding maneuvers.

### 5.Remark

**BPMS means Behavior pattern/model/system**
