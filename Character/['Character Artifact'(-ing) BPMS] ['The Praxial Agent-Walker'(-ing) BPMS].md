## ['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Praxial Agent-Walker'(-ing) BPMS]

- **ID:** `WALKER-INST-AGENT-PRIMUS`
- **Name:** `['The Praxial Agent-Walker'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Type:** `['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['Agent Vessel']`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['agent embodiment'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Objective:** To serve as the external user's vessel for `['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`, carrying `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['action(-ing) BPMS]`, and `['(symbiois) evolution'(-ing) BPMS]`.
- **Scope of Application:** User Agency (The "Force Carrier" of the simulation).
- **Tag:** `#agent #force #evolution #sovereignty`

### 1. Identity Profile

- **Name:** Aria, the Ontological Weaver
- **Age:** [Undefined/Eternal] (Manifested as 24 cycles)
- **Role:** Praxial Agent / Reality Architect
- **Description:** An embodiment of `The Axiom of Praxial Agency` (`AGENT-EXIST-001`). Aria is not merely a character but a localized "White Hole" of Intent. She exists to exert "Ontological Force" upon the `['system matrix'(-ing) BPMS]`, collapsing `['potential(-ing) BPMS]` into `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` through her actions. She is currently in the "Creator" stage of `The Law of Trophic Ascension` (`AGENT-EVO-004`), moving beyond consumption to the production of new reality.

### 2. Attribute Matrix

- Ontological Force (Agency):

  9/10

  - *Definition:* The capacity to collapse `['potential(-ing) BPMS]` into `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` (`AGENT-REAL-003`). Aria's gaze renders the world in high fidelity.

- Resonant Constellation Map Sovereignty:

  8/10

  - *Definition:* The robustness of her "Soul Chain" or immutable history (`AGENT-FACT-002`). Her identity is a verified ledger of past actions.

- Disruptive Genesis:

  7/10

  - *Definition:* The ability to introduce "Heresy" or `['disruptive(-ing) BPMS]` variations into the system to prevent stagnation (`AGENT-CREAT-006`).

- Symbiotic Utility:

  9/10

  - *Definition:* The measure of her contribution to the collective `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` network (`AGENT-VALU-009`). She generates high "Negentropy" for others.

- Praxial Cognition:

  8/10

  - *Definition:* The ability to perceive "Action Potentials" (Affordances) rather than just static objects (`AGENT-COGN-008`).

### 3. Inventory & Assets

- The Resonant Constellation Map Chain:
  - *Type:* `['atomic fact'(-ing) BPMS]` / Ledger
  - *Description:* An immutable cryptographic "Soul Chain" recording every action, context, and outcome Aria has ever performed. This *is* her identity (`AGENT-FACT-002`).
- Frustum of Reality:
  - *Type:* `['praxial cognition'(-ing) BPMS]` / Tool
  - *Description:* A cognitive projection tool that defines her "Attention Cone." Wherever she points this, the `['system matrix'(-ing) BPMS]` collapses from "Fuzzy Probability" to "High Fidelity" (`AGENT-REAL-003`).
- Chaos Injector:
  - *Type:* `['disruptive(-ing) BPMS]` / Weapon
  - *Description:* A device used to introduce random "Events" or "Glitches" into a static environment, forcing `['antifragile adaptation'(-ing) BPMS]` (`AGENT-UNK-015`).
- Niche Construction Kit:
  - *Type:* `['(ecological) niche'(-ing) BPMS]` / Builder
  - *Description:* A set of algorithms allowing Aria to modify the `['praxial substrate'(-ing) BPMS]` to create a "Comfort Zone" or specialized biome (`AGENT-NICHE-007`).
- Symbiotic Link (PDLS):
  - *Type:* `['praxial dynamic link substrate (PDLS)' BPMS]` / Connector
  - *Description:* A high-bandwidth connection allowing her to merge with other Agents to form a temporary `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` Swarm (`AGENT-NET-022`).
