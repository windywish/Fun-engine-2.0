## ['Praxial Skill Cell (PSC)'(-ing) BPMS]: ['Viral Knowledge Vector'(-ing) BPMS]

##### **Framework Foundation **

This instance serves as the foundational implementation of **`['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`** within the Fun Engine Framework, but modeled through the lens of **`[virology(-ing) BPMS]`**. It addresses the problem of "Static Knowledge" by treating facts as "Viruses" that must infect, replicate, and mutate within the **`['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]`** to survive. It represents the symbiotic evolution of **`[biolog(-ing) BPMS]`** (The Mechanism) and **`[epistemology(-ing) BPMS]`** (The Content).

##### **Constitutional Pillars Referenced**

- **The Axiom of Viral Ontology (MEME-SEE-001):** To exist is to infect. A fact that is not shared is dead.
- **The Protocol of Somatic Information Encoding (MEME-BIO-INST-001):** Information is written into the "body" of the system.
- **The Law of Substrate Independence (MEME-EVO-003):** The viral code (Fact) matters more than the host (File).
- **The Principle of Resonance Dynamics (MEME-FORM-005):** Infection requires a matching frequency between the virus and the host.

##### **Praxial Triage: Analysis**

- **The Problem:** In traditional databases, facts are passive rows in a table. They do not "fight" to be relevant. This leads to "Data Rot" where the system is full of obsolete, unused facts.
- **The Solution:** We instantiate the Fact as a **Retrovirus**. It has a "Capsid" (Context Shell) and "RNA" (Core Truth). It actively seeks out "Host Cells" (User Contexts, Other PSCs) to inject its truth. If it is useful, it replicates. If not, it dies.
- **Systemic Implication:** This creates an **`['evolutionary epistemology(-ing) BPMS]`**. Only the most "fit" facts survive in the system's memory, ensuring the Knowledge Base is always lean, relevant, and highly contagious.

##### **How to...?**

- **How to infect the system?** The Cell wraps its atomic fact (e.g., "Magic is dangerous") in a compelling narrative shell (The Capsid). It attaches to a user query about "Spells" and injects the warning.
- **How to replicate?** If the user accepts the premise (e.g., "I'll be careful"), the Virus replicates into the **`['long-term memory'(-ing) BPMS]`** with a higher weight.
- **How to mutate?** If the user challenges the fact ("But what about Holy Magic?"), the Virus mutates its RNA to include an exception clause, becoming a stronger strain: "Magic is dangerous, *except* when sanctified."

##### **What if...?**

- **What if the host is immune?** If the user (Host) has a strong "Skepticism Firewall," the Virus fails to infect. It records this failure and evolves a new "Spike Protein" (Argument) for the next attempt.
- **What if it becomes a plague?** If a fact becomes *too* dominant (spamming every response), the **`['Praxial Immune System'(-ing) BPMS]`** (Moderation Layer) suppresses its replication rate.
- **What if it goes dormant?** The Virus can enter a "Lysogenic Cycle," hiding in the code (Implicit Layer) without expressing itself, waiting for the right trigger (Stress) to re-emerge.

##### **What is happening continuously?**

- **Scanning:** The Cell is constantly scanning the **`['Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)'(-ing) BPMS]`** for compatible receptors (Keywords).
- **Competition:** It is competing with "Rival Viruses" (Counter-Facts) for the limited attention span of the user.
- **Encoding:** It is rewriting the **`['system matrix'(-ing) BPMS]`** to make the environment more favorable for its own survival (Niche Construction).

##### **['Praxial Execution Cycle'(-ing) BPMS]**

1. **Adsorption (Targeting):** The Cell identifies a target context: `Context: "User asking about power."`
2. **Penetration (Injection):** It injects the payload: `Fact: "Power corrupts."`
3. **Uncoating (Reveal):** It strips away the metaphor to reveal the core mechanic: `Rule: "Gain +1 Corruption per spell."`
4. **Replication (Spread):** The user adopts the rule. The Cell copies itself to the `Global_Game_Settings`.
5. **Assembly (Mutation):** It combines with other facts to form a "Complex Virus" (Ideology).

##### **Implementation (Detail)**

- **Physical Architecture (The Code):**
  - Implemented as a Python Class `EpistemicRetrovirus` with methods `infect()`, `mutate()`, and `dormancy()`.
  - Uses a **Genetic Algorithm** to optimize the "Capsid" (Phrasing) based on user engagement metrics (Click-through rate, Sentiment).
- **Cognitive Architecture (The Mind):**
  - The Cell possesses a **"Selfish Gene"** drive. It cares only about the propagation of its Truth.
  - It uses **`['memetics(-ing) BPMS]`** logic to calculate its "R-naught" (Infection Rate).
- **Symbiotic Evolution Pathways:**
  - **With `['super intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]`: ** The Super Intelligence uses these viruses to "seed" ideas in the user's mind subtly.
  - **With `['sustainability(-ing) BPMS]`: ** Only sustainable truths survive the selection pressure.
- **Praxial Genesis Canon Application (3 Layers):**
  - Layer 1 (The Constitutional / Metaphysical Layer):
    - *Principle:* **"Truth is a living thing."**
    - *Application:* The Cell embodies the biological imperative to survive. Truth is not a static rock; it is a fighting organism.
  - Layer 2 (The Formalism Layer):
    - *Logic:*

dtdI=βSI−γI

(SIR Model). *   *Mechanism:* It uses **Epidemiological Models** to predict the spread of information. S is Susceptible Users, I is Infected Contexts. *   **Layer 3 (The Substrate / Phenomenological Layer):** *   *Experience:* The user feels **"Influence."** Ideas seem to "catch on" naturally. The world feels culturally alive as rumors and legends spread like a contagion.

##### **Summarize**

`PSC-FACT-BIO-003` is a **Praxial Skill Cell** that implements **`['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`** by modeling them as **Retroviruses**. It ensures that knowledge within the Fun Engine Framework is **adaptive**, **resilient**, and **self-propagating**, solving the problem of data stagnation through **`[biolog(-ing) BPMS]`** principles.
