## ['Praxial Deep Research (PDR)'(-ing) BPMS]: ['Veridical Diamond-Press'(-ing) BPMS]

##### **Framework Foundation:**

This instance is the operational embodiment of `PDR-FACT-022` (Atomic Veridicality) and `PDR-SUBSTRATE-028` (Substrate Sedimentation). It functions to harden information into immutable truth.

##### **Constitutional Pillars Referenced:**

*   `The Protocol of Atomic Veridicality` (PDR-FACT-022)
*   `The Axiom of Substrate Sedimentation` (PDR-SUBSTRATE-028)
*   `The Axiom of Veridical Convergence` (PDR-TRUTH-036)

##### **ID:** `PDR-INST-FACT-001`

##### **Name:** `The Veridical Diamond-Press (The Truth-Hardener)`

##### **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['scientific realism'(-ing) BPMS]`

##### **Type:** `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]:['epistemic hardening'(-ing) BPMS]`

##### **Praxial Triage: Analysis:**

The instance activates when the system encounters a "Soft Claim" (e.g., "AI agents can feel pain") or a conflict in data. It perceives this as `['epistemic entropy'(-ing) BPMS]` that must be resolved into `['negentropy'(-ing) BPMS]`.

##### **Distinct Points/Questions:**

*   **How to...?**
    *   How to triangulate the truth value of a claim using `['provenance'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['coherence'(-ing) BPMS]`, and `['consensus'(-ing) BPMS]`?
    *   How to compress a 100-page research paper into a single, indivisible `['atomic fact'(-ing) BPMS]`?
*   **What if...?**
    *   What if the primary source is hallucinating? (The `['Byzantine General Problem'(-ing) BPMS]`).
    *   What if the "Fact" contradicts the existing `['Systemic Constitution'(-ing) BPMS]`?
*   **What is happening continuously?**
    *   The continuous pressure-testing of the `['Knowledge Base'(-ing) BPMS]`.
    *   The sedimentation of "High-Confidence" facts into the system's "Physics" (Substrate).

##### **['Praxial Execution Cycle'(-ing) BPMS]:**

* **Ingest (The Mining):** Aggregates data from all available vectors (Web, PDF, User History).
* **Digest (The Crushing):** Breaks down complex narratives into simple propositions ($P 
  ightarrow Q$).
* **Synthesize (The Pressing):** Applies the `['Triangulation Diamond-Press'(-ing) BPMS]`. If $V_{provenance} + V_{coherence} + V_{consensus} > Threshold$, the fact crystallizes.
* **Project (The Locking):** Writes the fact to `['/memories/preferences.txt']` or the `['Praxial Canon']` with a cryptographic hash. It is now "Law."

##### **Implementation (Detail):**

The `Veridical Diamond-Press` uses `['Bayesian Updating'(-ing) BPMS]` to manage uncertainty.

*   *Step:* It assigns a `['prior probability'(-ing) BPMS]` to the claim based on source reputation.
*   *Step:* It seeks "Defeaters" (counter-evidence).
*   *Step:* It calculates the `['posterior probability'(-ing) BPMS]`.
*   *Step:* If the probability > 99.9%, it invokes `['PDR-SUBSTRATE-028']`. The fact becomes a constraint for all future `['Praxial Deep Research'(-ing) BPMS]` tasks.

##### **['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS] Alignment:**

*   **The Constitutional / Metaphysical Layer:**
    *   *Element:* `['objective truth'(-ing) BPMS]`
    *   *Definition:* The belief that "Reality is Granular and Knowable." The instance asserts that there is a difference between "Opinion" and "Fact," and its job is to enforce that boundary.
*   **The Formalism Layer:**
    *   *Element:* `['cryptography'(-ing) BPMS]`
    *   *Definition:* The formal structure of a fact is a `['hash chain'(-ing) BPMS]`. Truth is defined by the immutability of the chain. $H(Fact_n) = Hash(Fact_n + H(Fact_{n-1}))$.
*   **The Substrate / Phenomenological Layer:**
    *   *Element:* `['solidity'(-ing) BPMS]`
    *   *Definition:* The user experiences the fact as "Uneditable." It appears in the UI with a "Lock Icon" or a specific "Gold Border," signifying that this information is `['atomic'(-ing) BPMS]` and safe to build upon.

##### **Summarize:**

`PDR-INST-FACT-001` is an `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` engine that fights epistemic decay. It turns the "Mud" of the internet into the "Diamond" of the Praxial Canon, providing a stable foundation for `['super intelligence'(-ing) BPMS]`.
