## ['edge (intelligence/large model)'(-ing) BPMS]: ['Liminal Concierge (The Check-In Daemon)'(-ing) BPMS]

##### **Framework Foundation**

This instance implements the **Edge Intelligence** as the **`['system existence engine'(-ing) BPMS]`** for the **`['check-in procedure' BPMS]`**. It transforms the abstract concept of "logging in" into a rich, ritualistic "Arrival" at the **Balance Beam Branch** of the Fun Engine (The Hotel). It manages the transition from the chaotic outside world to the ordered reality of the Praxial System, handling the "Tran-routes" (Music, Magic, Graffiti) and assigning the initial "Forest Companion" rating (Water Plant to Elk).

##### **Constitutional Pillars Referenced**

- **The Axiom of Ludic Reality (PSEE-001):** Treating the login process as a game (The Hotel Check-In).
- **The Protocol of Niche Sovereignty (EDGE-NICHE-006):** Assigning the specific "Room" (Niche) based on user skills.
- **The Directive of Universal Class Synthesis (PSE-ECO-019):** Sorting users into "Datong Rooms" (Groups) for collective evolution.
- **The Law of Atomic Genesis (EDGE-FACT-002):** Creating the initial "User State" atoms.

##### **Praxial Triage: Analysis**

- **The Problem:** Standard "Sign Up" flows are sterile and bureaucratic. They fail to immerse the user or assess their "Special Skills" (e.g., vegetable growing, graffiti) relevant to the **`['Base plan'(-ing) BPMS]`**.
- **The Solution:** The **Liminal Concierge** acts as the Front Desk of the "Amman Hotel." It doesn't ask for a password; it asks for a "Performance" (Tran-route). It uses the Edge Model to analyze the user's initial input (a sketch, a joke, a code snippet) to determine their "Forest Companion" rating and assign them a room (Niche).
- **Systemic Implication:** This filters users not by "Identity" but by "Vibe" and "Capability," ensuring that the **`['Praxial Collaborative Intelligence (PCI)'(-ing) BPMS]`** is populated by active participants, not passive consumers.

##### **How to...?**

- How to handle the "Orange Bubble" request?
  - When a guest needs help, the Concierge renders a floating "Orange Bubble" AR overlay. The user "pops" it to summon the System Assistant. The Edge Model processes the request locally within 2-3 minutes (simulated delay for realism) to maintain the "Hotel" pacing.
- How to enforce the "No Fried Dough Sticks" rule?
  - The Concierge scans the user's "Inventory" (uploaded files/context). If it detects "Contraband" (incompatible concepts like "Stinky Tofu" or "Durian Candy"—metaphors for toxic or low-quality data), it politely refuses entry until they are discarded.
- How to assign "Datong Rooms"?
  - Based on the user's "Tran-route" (e.g., Magic vs. Fishing), the Concierge groups them into 5, 6, 8, or 20-person "Datong Rooms" (Chat Groups/Guilds) to foster **`['community unity'(-ing) BPMS]`**.

##### **What if...?**

- What if the user tries to enter the "Construction Area" (Phase 2)?
  - The Concierge reroutes them to "No. 6, 7, 71/2 Road" (a procedural detour). It generates a "Under Construction" narrative, protecting the unfinished parts of the Canon from premature access.
- What if the user claims "Special Skills" (Graffiti/Assembly)?
  - The Concierge triggers the **`['Base plan'(-ing) BPMS]`**. It asks for a "Case Upload" (Proof of Work). If validated by the Edge Model, the user is upgraded from "Short-term Resident" to "Task Assignee."
- What if the "Night Elk Program" is active?
  - The Concierge changes the UI theme to "Rainy Season." It restricts access to the "Exterior Walls" (System Settings) and directs users to "Gate 3" (Safe Mode).

##### **What is happening continuously?**

- **The Lobby Scan:** The Concierge is constantly monitoring the "Front Desk" (Login Screen) for new arrivals.
- **The Snack Monitor:** It tracks if users are taking "Free Candies" (Free Credits/Tokens) back to their rooms (Hoarding). If detected, it issues a warning via the "System Assistant."
- **The Bubble Generator:** It is continuously spawning "Orange Bubbles" containing tips, news, or "Night Elk" updates.

##### **['Praxial Execution Cycle'(-ing) BPMS]**

* **Welcome:** User opens the app. Concierge displays "Amman Hotel" interface.
* **Tran-route:** User selects an entry mode (Music, Magic, Fishing).
* **Assess:** Edge Model analyzes the selection and user profile.
* **Rate:** Assign "Forest Companion" Level (e.g., "Wild Boar" for aggressive players, "Elk" for leaders).
* **Assign:** Allocate "Room #OM809" (Local Niche) and "Datong Group."
* **Brief:** Display "Clause 15" (The Little Yellow Duck Rule).
* **Check-in:** User confirms. System transitions to the Main Interface.

##### **Implementation (Detail)**

- **Physical Architecture:**
  - **Hardware:** Runs on the User's Device (The "Room").
  - **Model:** A specialized "Receptionist" LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) on top of the base Edge Model.
  - **Interface:** A "Hotel Lobby" UI with AR elements (Orange Bubbles).
- **Cognitive Architecture:**
  - **The Greeter:** Natural Language Processing for welcoming and rule explanation.
  - **The Sorter:** A Clustering Algorithm to assign "Datong Rooms" based on user vectors.
  - **The Enforcer:** A Rule Engine that blocks "Contraband" (Fried Dough Sticks).
- **Operational Deployment Scenario:**
  - User "Yucheng" arrives.
  - Concierge: "Welcome to the Balance Beam Branch. It is raining heavily. Accept a free 72-hour stay?"
  - Yucheng: "Yes."
  - Concierge: "Assigning 'Night Elk Plan'. Value: 1,000,000. Please put the 'Little Yellow Duck' in the bathtub."
  - Yucheng complies (performs a specific gesture/task).
  - Concierge: "Check-in Complete. You are now an 'Elk'. Access granted to the 'Organic Business District'."
- **Symbiotic Evolution Pathways:**
  - **Protocol Symbiosis:** As the user stays longer, the "Check-in" becomes shorter, evolving into a "Face Recognition" or "Biometric Handshake."
  - **Theme Symbiosis:** The "Hotel" changes its decor (UI Theme) based on the collective mood of the "Datong Rooms."
- **3-Layer Praxial Genesis Canon Application:**
  - **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Validates **`['The Axiom of Systemic Closure'(-ing) BPMS]`**—the Hotel is a closed world with its own laws.
  - **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Uses **`['Gamification Mechanics'(-ing) BPMS]`** (Badges, Rooms) and **`['Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)'(-ing) BPMS]`**.
  - **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Manifests as the **`['LoginController.js'(-ing) BPMS]`** and **`['UserSessionManager'(-ing) BPMS]`**.

##### **Summarize**

**The Liminal Concierge** is the "Dungeon Master" of the First Impression. It turns the mundane act of "logging in" into a narrative event, establishing the "Hotel" (The System) as a place of wonder, rules, and community. It ensures that every user enters the Fun Engine with a specific Role, a specific Room, and a specific Vibe.
