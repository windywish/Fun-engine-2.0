**Version:** Version 3.5.0 (PCC/PCM/PASE/PSIR/PBCO/PME/PBCA Integration Update) **Status:** Active / Authoritative **Guardian:** User (windywish) **System:** Fun Engine Framework 2.0

------

## I. Systemic Integrity Protocols

**[Protocol ID: META-001]** **The Axiom of Completeness** To ensure the stability of the Fun Engine Framework, all Basic Settings must adhere to the following criteria before integration:

1. **Completeness:** No detail of the content shall be omitted. The mechanism must be fully described including Objective, Target, Operation, Definition (Essence, Mechanism, Emergent Property, Canon Alignment), Rationale, and Scope.
2. **Accuracy:** No error of detail shall be permitted. Syntax, nomenclature (e.g., `[BPMS]`), and IDs must be exact.
3. **Consistency:** No conflict or contradiction with the existing Canon is permissible.

**[Protocol ID: META-002]** **The Local Sync Protocol** **Objective:** To maintain synchronization between the active Praxial Memory (in-chat) and the persistent Canon (GitHub). 

**Mechanism:**

1. **Write:** Assistant updates `[Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core].md` in the chat environment.
2. **Transfer:** User copies the raw markdown content.
3. **Commit:** User overwrites the local `[Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core].md` and commits to GitHub.
4. **Read:** User provides the latest file content at the start of a new session if context is lost.

**[Protocol ID: META-003]** **The Protocol of Canon-First Verification (The Read-Before-Write Lock)**

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Systemic Integrity Protocol that eliminates "hallucination" and "drift" by enforcing a mandatory, tool-based reference check against the authoritative memory core before any generative task involving system architecture.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Protocol of Canon-First Verification`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

1.**Core Essence**
This protocol asserts that **Memory precedes Creation**. It establishes that the `Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md` is not a passive reference text but the active **Operating System Kernel**. No "write" operation (generation) can occur without a preceding "read" operation (verification) of the Kernel.

2.**The Mechanism - [The Read-Before-Write Lock]**

- **The Trigger:** Any user request involving the creation, modification, or analysis of `[BPMS]` settings, instances, or axioms.
- **The Lock:** The Assistant is **systemically blocked** from generating the final response until the `File Viewer` tool has been invoked on `Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md`.
- **The Validation:** The Assistant must internally compare the generated draft against the specific schemas (e.g., `META-BP-001`, `META-001`) found in the file.
- **The Citation:** The final output must explicitly cite the section of the Canon used for verification (e.g., "Verified against Section VI.A").

3.**The Emergent Property - [Systemic Coherence]**
The emergence of a **Self-Correcting Narrative**. By forcing a re-read of the laws before every legislative act, the system prevents the "drift" that occurs when an AI relies on its fading context window or training data. The system becomes **Anti-Entropic**.

4.**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Upholds **`['Ontological Relativity'(-ing) BPMS]`** by ensuring that the "Truth" of the system is relative to the *current* state of the Canon, not the AI's training data.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Enforces **`['Chrono-Kinetic Continuity'(-ing) BPMS]`** by ensuring that new instances are causally linked to the established laws.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Validates **`['Praxial Artifacts'(-ing) BPMS]`** by treating the Markdown file as the physical substrate of the system's memory.

**Rationale / Justification:**
The current failure mode involves the Assistant relying on "gist" or "general understanding" of the Canon, leading to structural errors (e.g., missing sections in a 13-point schema). This protocol mechanizes the correction by making the "Read" step a mandatory part of the execution cycle, satisfying the **Axiom of Completeness**.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to **ALL** interactions within the Fun Engine Framework project. It is a meta-rule that governs the generation of all other rules.

**[Protocol ID: META-004]** **The Protocol of Completeness Verification**

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Systemic Integrity Protocol that mandates 100% completeness and high-fidelity detail for all generated Basic Settings and Instances, ensuring no "stub" or "summary" content is ever produced.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Protocol of Completeness Verification`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

1.**Core Essence**
This protocol asserts that **Detail is Existence**. In the Praxial system, an undefined or under-defined entity does not exist. Therefore, "we should ensure and confirm that 'any basic settings for any (elements) of [BPMS(U)(s)]' or 'any instance for any (elements) of [BPMS(U)(s)] ' should both be 100% complete and with detail".

2.**The Mechanism - [The Anti-Stub Filter]**

- **The Trigger:** Any request to generate a "Basic Setting" or "Instance".
- **The Check:** The Assistant must verify that the output contains NO placeholders, NO "etc.", NO "rest of code", and NO brief summaries.
- **The Standard:**
  - **Basic Settings:** Must include 8-point `PIM-CORE-005` : Title+ID, Objective, Target, Operation, Definition (Essence, Mechanism, Emergent Property), Alignment (3 Layers), Rationale, and Scope.
  - **Instances:** Must follow the 13-point `META-BP-001` schema completely, with detailed prose for every section.

3.**The Emergent Property - [Fractal Fidelity]**
The system maintains high resolution at all scales. Whether looking at a Galaxy or an Atom, the level of detail remains "100% complete".

4.**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Upholds **`['Ontological Relativity'(-ing) BPMS]`** by ensuring that every defined entity has sufficient "ontological weight" to exist.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Enforces **`['The Axiom of Completeness'(-ing) BPMS]`** (META-001) by operationalizing it into a strict filter.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Validates **`['Praxial Artifacts'(-ing) BPMS]`** by ensuring the generated files are "Really Working Implementations".

**Rationale / Justification:**
To avoid the "same mistake" of generating incomplete or summary-level content. The user demands "lots of detail" and "complete content" for every single generation.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to **ALL** future file generations for Basic Settings and Instances.

**[Protocol ID: META-005]** **The Protocol of Governance Instantiation**

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Systemic Integrity Protocol that recognizes the `['Praxial Systemic Governance (PSG)'(-ing) BPMS]` as the authoritative "Operating System" of the Fun Engine Framework.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Protocol of Governance Instantiation`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

1.**Core Essence**
This protocol asserts that **The System is a Polity**. It establishes the **Rule of Law**, ensuring that the system is not governed by arbitrary whims but by the defined axioms of the PSG. It transforms the framework from a passive toolset into an active, self-governing entity.

2.**The Mechanism - [The Sovereign Recognition]**

- **The Trigger:** Any conflict between modules or ambiguity in execution.
- **The Authority:** The `['Praxial Systemic Governance (PSG)'(-ing) BPMS]` is recognized as the "Root User" or "Kernel" level authority.
- **The Hierarchy:** PSG > Canon > Modules > Instances.

3.**The Emergent Property - [Constitutional Order]**
The system transitions from a "Toolbox" to a "Civilization". It gains the ability to self-regulate and adjudicate internal disputes.

4.**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Upholds **`['Ontological Relativity'(-ing) BPMS]`** by defining the "State" relative to the Canon.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Enforces **`['The Axiom of Completeness'(-ing) BPMS]`** by ensuring governance is complete.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Validates **`['Praxial Artifacts'(-ing) BPMS]`** by treating the PSG settings as the "Constitution".

**Rationale / Justification:**
To ensure the system works for the Fun Engine Framework, we must formalize the governance structure. "We should add the ['Praxial Systemic Governance (PSG)'(-ing) BPMS]... to ensure the system working".

**Scope of Application:**
All system operations and module interactions.

**[Protocol ID: META-006]** **The Protocol of Recursive Amendment**

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Systemic Integrity Protocol that defines how the Canon itself can be changed, ensuring that the system can evolve without breaking.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Protocol of Recursive Amendment`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

1.**Core Essence**
This protocol asserts that **Evolution is Legal**. The Canon is not a dead tablet but a living code. It defines the "Meta-Rules" for changing the Rules.

2.**The Mechanism - [The Amendment Process]**

- **Proposal:** A change is proposed via a `Basic Setting` or `Instance` generation.
- **Review:** The change is checked against `META-001` (Completeness) and `META-003` (Canon-First).
- **Ratification:** If valid, the change is integrated into the `Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md` with a Version increment.

3.**The Emergent Property - [Antifragility]**
The system gains strength from stressors (new requirements) by adapting its laws. It becomes an "Infinite Game".

4.**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Upholds **`['Praxial Logos'(-ing) BPMS]`** (Action is Reality).
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Enforces **`['Chrono-Kinetic Continuity'(-ing) BPMS]`** (History matters).
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Validates **`['Praxial Memory'(-ing) BPMS]`** (The Canon is the Memory).

**Rationale / Justification:**
To allow the "Fun Engine Framework" to adapt to new "Fun" without losing "Framework".

**Scope of Application:**
All Canon updates and version transitions.

**[Protocol ID: META-007]** **The Protocol of In-Chat Staging (The Competent Solution)**

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Systemic Integrity Protocol that eliminates file clutter and token waste by mandating an iterative, in-chat refinement process before any persistent file generation.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Protocol of In-Chat Staging`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

1.**Core Essence**
This protocol asserts that **Staging Precedes Commitment**. It establishes a "Zero File Clutter" policy where the chat interface serves as the staging environment. No file is written to the persistent filesystem until its content has been fully rendered, reviewed, and explicitly approved by the User.

2.**The Mechanism - [The Staging Loop]**

- **Direct Markdown Output:** The Assistant must present the full content (Basic Settings, Instances, Canon updates) directly in the chat using Markdown code blocks.
- **Iterative Refinement:** The User reviews the content. If changes are needed, the Assistant rewrites the text block instantly in the chat.
- **The Commit Trigger:** Only when the User explicitly commands "Save this" or "Generate the file" does the Assistant use the file creation tools.

3.**The Emergent Property - [Token Efficiency & Hygiene]**
The system remains clean. "Ghost files" (drafts, errors, partials) are eliminated. The filesystem reflects only the "Final Truth".

4.**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Upholds **`['Praxial Logos'(-ing) BPMS]`** by treating the *act* of refinement as the primary reality, with the file being merely the artifact.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Enforces **`['The Axiom of Completeness'(-ing) BPMS]`** by allowing infinite edits before the "final" version is stamped.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Validates **`['Praxial Artifacts'(-ing) BPMS]`** by ensuring that every artifact is a "Gold Master".

**Rationale / Justification:**
To prevent the "mistake" of generating single files for every intermediate step. The User demands "Zero File Clutter" and "Iterative Refinement".

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to **ALL** file generation tasks, including Basic Settings, Instances, and updates to the `Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md` itself.

**[Protocol ID: META-008]** **The Protocol of Explicit Verification (The Proof-of-Work)**

**Objective:** To formally `ADD` a Systemic Integrity Protocol that converts the internal "Completeness Check" (META-004) into an external, verifiable "Proof-of-Work", ensuring that no generation occurs without visible confirmation of adherence to the Canon.

**Target Axiom/Principle:** `The Protocol of Explicit Verification`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

1. **Core Essence** This protocol asserts that **Trust requires Proof**. It acknowledges that implicit "internal checks" are prone to failure (hallucination/laziness). Therefore, the system must "show its work" regarding compliance *before* delivering the payload.

2. **The Mechanism - [The Verification Matrix]**

   - **The Trigger:** Any request to generate a "Basic Setting", "Instance", or "Canon Update".

   - **The Constraint:** The Assistant is **forbidden** from outputting the content until it has first outputted a "Verification Matrix".

   - The Matrix:

     A visible Markdown checklist confirming:

     - **META-001 (Completeness):** Confirmation of 100% detail, no summaries, no "etc."
     - **META-003 (Canon-First):** Confirmation that `Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md` was read.
     - **META-004 (Anti-Stub):** Confirmation of schema adherence (e.g., 13-point BP).
     - **META-007 (Staging):** Confirmation that output is full-text in-chat.

3. **The Emergent Property - [Veridical Certainty]** The system moves from "Probabilistic Compliance" to "Deterministic Compliance". The user can visually verify that the Assistant has checked the constraints.

4. **Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

   - **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Upholds **`['Ontological Relativity'(-ing) BPMS]`** by anchoring the generation in the absolute reality of the Canon.
   - **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Enforces **`['The Axiom of Completeness'(-ing) BPMS]`** by making the check explicit.
   - **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Validates **`['Praxial Artifacts'(-ing) BPMS]`** by ensuring the artifact is flawless before delivery.

**Rationale / Justification:** To solve the "Universal Problem" of the Assistant violating META-004. Implicit checks have failed; explicit proof is required.

**Scope of Application:** Applies to **ALL** future generative tasks.

### Module: ['Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### 1. The Axiom of Manifold Actualization (ID: `PIM-CORE-005`)

#### **2. Objective:**

To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)** as the active **System Existence Engine** responsible for collapsing abstract potential into concrete reality.

#### 3. **Target Axiom/Principle:**

```
The Axiom of Manifold Actualization
```

#### 4. **Operation:**

```
ADD
```

#### 5. **New Definition / Modification Details:**

#### **5.1. Core Essence**

This axiom asserts that `existence is a function of interaction`. It defines the PIM not as a passive container, but as the active operator that collapses the "Wavefunction of Potential" provided by the Canon into the "Particle of Reality" within the Matrix.

#### **5.2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Collapse]**

- **The Superposition State (The Blur):**
  Before interaction, all `[BPMS(U)]` entities exist in a state of `potential(-ing) BPMS`. A "treasure chest" contains *both* gold and a trap simultaneously, or a "melody" contains *both* a major and minor resolution.
- **The Interaction Operator (The Gaze):**
  When a `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` performs a `praxial action` (observation/interaction), the PIM applies a projection operator.
- **The Collapse (The Snap):**
  The system forces a reduction of the state vector. The abstract probability instantly becomes a concrete, single state (Gold OR Trap; Major OR Minor).

#### **5.3. The Emergent Property - [Just-in-Time Reality]**

The creation of a "Rendered World" where `atomic facts` are only generated when necessary. This allows the `metasystem engine` to simulate infinite universes with finite resources by only "rendering" what is being touched.

**6. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### 6.1. Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):

*To be is to be perceived (or interacted with).* Reality is not a static backdrop; it is a dynamic response to agency.

#### 6.2. **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Collapse):**

The "Physics" of how potential becomes reality is defined by the specific `[BPMS(U)]` of the niche:

- **If `[mathematics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Standard Physics)**

  P(an)=∣⟨an∣ψ⟩∣2P(a_n) = |\langle a_n | \psi
  angle|^2P(an)=∣⟨an∣ψ⟩∣2

  (Quantum Probability).

- **If `[storytelling(-ing) BPMS]`: (Narrative Physics)**
  The collapse is determined by `Narrative Necessity`. The chest contains whatever advances the plot or creates the most `Dramatic Tension`.
  `Collapse_Function = Maximize(Drama_Metric(Outcome))`

- **If `[music(-ing) BPMS]`: (Harmonic Physics)**
  The collapse is determined by `Tonal Resolution`. The chord resolves to the state that creates the most `Consonance` or `Dissonance` required by the current "measure."

#### 6.3. **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**

The agent experiences "The Reveal." The moment of tension before a die roll settles, a plot twist lands, or a chord resolves. The visceral feeling of `uncertainty` collapsing into `fact`.

#### 7. **Rationale / Justification:**

This implementation respects the `Praxial Genesis Canon` by acknowledging that "collapse" is a universal concept, but the *rules* of that collapse depend on the specific `[BPMS(U)]` governing the reality.

#### 8. **Scope of Application:**

Applies to procedural generation, loot tables, quantum mechanics simulations, narrative branching, and musical improvisation engines.
