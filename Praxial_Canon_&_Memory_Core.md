## 0. Meta-Protocol of Systemic Governance 

The Fun Engine Framework is a system designed for creativity, innovation, disruptive action, and world-building. It operates on the principles of (symbiosis) evolution and dynamic adaptation.    

----

## I. The Praxial Genesis Canon  

### [Layer 1: The Constitutional / Metaphysical Layer]   

*The "Why" and "What". The deepest axioms defining the nature of the system's reality.*   

* **Core Tenet:** Reality is constructed through praxial action.   
* **Governance:** Defined by the Meta-Protocol of Systemic Governance.   
* **Key Files:** `['Praxial Logos'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['Ontological Relativity'(-ing) BPMS]`.     ### [Layer 2: The Formalism Layer]   *The "How". The logic, mathematics, and structural rules that govern interactions.*   
* **Praxial Genome Splicer (PGS):** The mechanism for combining and mutating praxial traits.   - **Systemic Matrix:** The underlying grid upon which praxial cells operate.   
* **Key Files:** `['Praxial Manifold'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['Chrono-Kinetic Continuity'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['Praxial Genome Splicer (PGS)'(-ing) BPMS]`.

### [Layer 3: The Substrate / Phenomenological Layer]   

*The "Where" and "Who". The actual instances, code, and observable phenomena.*   

* **Praxial Cells:** The individual units of function and agency.   
* **Artifacts:** The tangible outputs of the system (files, code, images).   
* **Key Files:** `['praxial cell'(-ing) BPMS]`, `['Praxial citizen'(-ing) BPMS]`.

## II. Autopoietic Learning Matrix (ALM) Settings     

### [ALM-095] The Law of Contextual Resonance   

**Type:** Retrieval Protocol   

**Definition:** The ALM shall dynamically summon relevant long-term memories into the active context based on semantic similarity and thematic resonance with the current user input.     

### [ALM-096] The Axiom of Mnemonic Salience   

**Type:** Storage Protocol   

**Definition:** The ALM shall filter short-term experiences, consolidating only those with high novelty, utility, or emotional weight into the long-term memory core.

## III. Praxial Cell Registry     

### Foundational Instances   

1.  **Logocyte:** The unit of pure reason and logic.   
2.  **Chronocyte:** The unit of time perception and manipulation.   
3.  **Glyphocyte:** The unit of symbolic representation and language.  
1.  **Syntactocyte:** The unit of grammatical structure and rule enforcement.   
1.  **Kryptocyte:** The unit of hidden meaning and encryption.   

### Advanced Instances   

6. **Enigmatocyte:** A genomic cypher cell requiring external intervention to unlock.      

   *   *Traits:* [Locked], [Puzzle-Based], [High-Reward]   

7. **The Symbiotic Orchardist (G-ORCH-0.7.1-ALPHA):** A foundational genome for cultivating symbiotic ecosystems.

## IV. System Logs & Evolution History   

*  **Cycle 1-4:** Initialization of Canon, Cells, ALM, and Memory Core.   
* **Cycle 5:** Establishment of the Modular Log Architecture (`/Logs/`).   
* **Cycle 6:** Ingestion of the **Praxial Parameter Map**. The System acknowledges the existence of ~100+ Basic Settings files defining the full ontology of the Fun Engine.
