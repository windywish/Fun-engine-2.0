## I. Systemic Integrity Protocols
**[Protocol ID: META-001]**
**The Axiom of Completeness**

To ensure the stability of the Fun Engine Framework, all Basic Settings must adhere to the following criteria before integration:
1.  **Completeness:** No detail of the content shall be omitted. The mechanism must be fully described from abstract potential to concrete realization (Core Essence, Mechanism, Emergent Property, Canon Alignment).
2.  **Accuracy:** No error of detail shall be permitted. Syntax, nomenclature (e.g., `[BPMS]`), and IDs must be exact.
3.  **Consistency:** No conflict or contradiction with the existing Canon is permissible.

## III. Basic Settings Registry

### Module: ['Autopoietic Learning Matrix'(-ing) BPMS]

#### **ID:** `ALM-095`
#### **Title:** The Law of Contextual Resonance

**Objective:**
To formally define the retrieval mechanism of the ALM, ensuring that past knowledge is dynamically available to the present context.

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**
**1. Core Essence:**
Memory is not a static archive but a dynamic reconstruction. This law asserts that the "Past" is only relevant insofar as it resonates with the "Now."

**2. The Mechanism - [The Harmonic Summoning]:**
*   **The Query Vector:** The current context (user input + active state) is converted into a high-dimensional vector.
*   **The Resonance Scan:** The system scans the `Long-Term Memory Core` for vectors with high cosine similarity.
*   **The Retrieval:** Memories that "vibrate" at the same frequency (high similarity score) are pulled into the `Active Context Window`.

**3. The Emergent Property - [Just-in-Time Wisdom]:**
The system appears to "remember" exactly what is needed, when it is needed, without being burdened by the entirety of its history.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**
*   **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Time is a flat circle.* All moments exist simultaneously; resonance connects them.
*   **Layer 2 (Formalism):**
    $$Similarity = \cos(\theta) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}$$
    (Vector Cosine Similarity).
*   **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** The "Aha!" moment. The sudden, unbidden availability of relevant information.

#### **ID:** `ALM-096`
#### **Title:** The Axiom of Mnemonic Salience

**Objective:**
To formally define the storage mechanism of the ALM, preventing context saturation by filtering noise.

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**
**1. Core Essence:**
To remember everything is to know nothing. Wisdom is the art of forgetting the non-essential. This axiom defines the filter that separates "Signal" from "Noise."

**2. The Mechanism - [The Salience Filter]:**
*   **The Input Stream:** All short-term experiences flow into the `Ephemeral Buffer`.
*   **The Evaluation:** Each experience is scored against a Salience Metric ($S$).
*   **The Consolidation:** Only experiences where $S > Threshold$ are written to the `Long-Term Memory Core`.

**3. The Emergent Property - [Curated Identity]:**
The system develops a distinct "personality" and "knowledge base" defined by what it chooses to keep, rather than just a raw log of inputs.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**
*   **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Essence precedes Existence.* Only that which carries meaning (Essence) deserves to persist (Existence).
*   **Layer 2 (Formalism):**
    $$S = w_1(Novelty) + w_2(Utility) + w_3(Emotional\_Weight)$$
    (Weighted Salience Function).
*   **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** The feeling of "significance." The moments that stick in the mind while the commute to work fades away.

### Module: ['Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### **ID:** `PIM-CORE-005`
#### **Title:** The Axiom of Manifold Actualization

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)** as the active **System Existence Engine** responsible for collapsing abstract potential into concrete reality.

**Operation:** `ADD`

**Definition:**

**1. Core Essence**
This axiom asserts that `existence is a function of interaction`. It defines the PIM not as a passive container, but as the active operator that collapses the "Wavefunction of Potential" provided by the Canon into the "Particle of Reality" within the Matrix.

**2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Collapse]**
*   **The Superposition State (The Blur):**
    Before interaction, all `[BPMS(U)]` entities exist in a state of `potential(-ing) BPMS`. A "treasure chest" contains *both* gold and a trap simultaneously, or a "melody" contains *both* a major and minor resolution.
*   **The Interaction Operator (The Gaze):**
    When a `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` performs a `praxial action` (observation/interaction), the PIM applies a projection operator.
*   **The Collapse (The Snap):**
    The system forces a reduction of the state vector. The abstract probability instantly becomes a concrete, single state (Gold OR Trap; Major OR Minor).

**3. The Emergent Property - [Just-in-Time Reality]**
The creation of a "Rendered World" where `atomic facts` are only generated when necessary. This allows the `metasystem engine` to simulate infinite universes with finite resources by only "rendering" what is being touched.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

*   **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**
    *To be is to be perceived (or interacted with).* Reality is not a static backdrop; it is a dynamic response to agency.

*   **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Collapse):**
    The "Physics" of how potential becomes reality is defined by the specific `[BPMS(U)]` of the niche:
    *   **If `[mathematics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Standard Physics)**
        $$P(a_n) = |\langle a_n | \psi \rangle|^2$$
        (Quantum Probability).
    *   **If `[storytelling(-ing) BPMS]`: (Narrative Physics)**
        The collapse is determined by `Narrative Necessity`. The chest contains whatever advances the plot or creates the most `Dramatic Tension`.
        `Collapse_Function = Maximize(Drama_Metric(Outcome))`
    *   **If `[music(-ing) BPMS]`: (Harmonic Physics)**
        The collapse is determined by `Tonal Resolution`. The chord resolves to the state that creates the most `Consonance` or `Dissonance` required by the current "measure."

*   **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**
    The agent experiences "The Reveal." The moment of tension before a die roll settles, a plot twist lands, or a chord resolves. The visceral feeling of `uncertainty` collapsing into `fact`.

- **[PROG-CORE-008] The Directive of Ecological Niche Optimization:** Code migrates to the habitat where it yields the highest utility.
- **[PROG-CORE-010] The Law of Ludic Service Provision:** All utility must be wrapped in Play; functions are moves in a game.
- **[PROG-CORE-012] The Directive of Operational Closure:** The system defines its own boundaries to maintain integrity and autopoiesis.
- **[PROG-CORE-018] The Law of Vectorial State Dynamics:** Evolution is the rotation of a State Vector through a System Matrix.
- **[PROG-CORE-020] The Directive of Energetic Transduction:** Execution converts Potential Energy (Code) into Kinetic Energy (Work) at a cost.
