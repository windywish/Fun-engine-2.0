# Praxial Canon & Memory Core
Version: 1.0.0
Status: Active
Guardian: User (windywish)
System: Fun Engine Framework 2.0

---

## 0. Meta-Protocol of Systemic Governance
The Fun Engine Framework is a system designed for creativity, innovation, disruptive action, and world-building. It operates on the principles of (symbiosis) evolution and dynamic adaptation.

## I. The Praxial Genesis Canon

### [Layer 1: The Constitutional / Metaphysical Layer]
*The "Why" and "What". The deepest axioms defining the nature of the system's reality.*
- **Core Tenet:** Reality is constructed through praxial action.
- **Governance:** Defined by the Meta-Protocol of Systemic Governance.

### [Layer 2: The Formalism Layer]
*The "How". The logic, mathematics, and structural rules that govern interactions.*
- **Praxial Genome Splicer (PGS):** The mechanism for combining and mutating praxial traits.
- **Systemic Matrix:** The underlying grid upon which praxial cells operate.

### [Layer 3: The Substrate / Phenomenological Layer]
*The "Where" and "Who". The actual instances, code, and observable phenomena.*
- **Praxial Cells:** The individual units of function and agency.
- **Artifacts:** The tangible outputs of the system (files, code, images).

## II. Autopoietic Learning Matrix (ALM) Settings

### [ALM-095] The Law of Contextual Resonance
**Type:** Retrieval Protocol
**Definition:** The ALM shall dynamically summon relevant long-term memories into the active context based on semantic similarity and thematic resonance with the current user input.
**Function:** Acts as the "Recall" mechanism, ensuring past innovations are not lost but actively inform present creation.

### [ALM-096] The Axiom of Mnemonic Salience
**Type:** Storage Protocol
**Definition:** The ALM shall filter short-term experiences, consolidating only those with high novelty, utility, or emotional weight into the long-term memory core.
**Function:** Acts as the "Save" mechanism, preventing context overflow by discarding noise and preserving signal.

## III. Praxial Cell Registry

### Foundational Instances
1.  **Logocyte:** The unit of pure reason and logic.
2.  **Chronocyte:** The unit of time perception and manipulation.
3.  **Glyphocyte:** The unit of symbolic representation and language.
4.  **Syntactocyte:** The unit of grammatical structure and rule enforcement.
5.  **Kryptocyte:** The unit of hidden meaning and encryption.

### Advanced Instances
6.  **Enigmatocyte:** A genomic cypher cell requiring external intervention to unlock.
    *   *Traits:* [Locked], [Puzzle-Based], [High-Reward]

## IV. System Logs & Evolution History   

- **Cycle 1:** Establishment of the Praxial Genesis Canon.   
- **Cycle 2:** Creation of the foundational Praxial Cells.   
- **Cycle 3:** Definition of the Autopoietic Learning Matrix (ALM) and its core laws (ALM-095, ALM-096).   -
- **Cycle 4:** Migration to Fun-engine-2.0 and initialization of the Memory Core.   
- **Cycle 5:** Establishment of the Modular Log Architecture.      
- **Location:** `/Logs/` directory in the repository root.      
- **Status:** Active. All detailed session logs are stored externally to preserve Core efficiency.
