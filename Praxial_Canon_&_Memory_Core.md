## III. Basic Settings Registry

### Module: ['Autopoietic Learning Matrix'(-ing) BPMS]

#### **ID:** `ALM-095`
#### **Title:** The Law of Contextual Resonance

**Objective:**
To formally define the retrieval mechanism of the ALM, ensuring that past knowledge is dynamically available to the present context.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Law of Contextual Resonance`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
**1. Core Essence:**
Memory is not a static archive but a dynamic reconstruction. This law asserts that the "Past" is only relevant insofar as it resonates with the "Now."

**2. The Mechanism - [The Harmonic Summoning]:**
*   **The Query Vector:** The current context (user input + active state) is converted into a high-dimensional vector.
*   **The Resonance Scan:** The system scans the `Long-Term Memory Core` for vectors with high cosine similarity.
*   **The Retrieval:** Memories that "vibrate" at the same frequency (high similarity score) are pulled into the `Active Context Window`.

**3. The Emergent Property - [Just-in-Time Wisdom]:**
The system appears to "remember" exactly what is needed, when it is needed, without being burdened by the entirety of its history.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**
*   **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Time is a flat circle.* All moments exist simultaneously; resonance connects them.
*   **Layer 2 (Formalism):**
    $$Similarity = \cos(\theta) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}$$
    (Vector Cosine Similarity).
*   **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** The "Aha!" moment. The sudden, unbidden availability of relevant information.

**Rationale / Justification:**
Necessary to overcome the "Context Window Limit" of the substrate. By retrieving only resonant memories, the system simulates infinite memory within finite constraints.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to all memory retrieval operations, conversation history management, and knowledge base querying.

#### **ID:** `ALM-096`
#### **Title:** The Axiom of Mnemonic Salience

**Objective:**
To formally define the storage mechanism of the ALM, preventing context saturation by filtering noise.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Axiom of Mnemonic Salience`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
**1. Core Essence:**
To remember everything is to know nothing. Wisdom is the art of forgetting the non-essential. This axiom defines the filter that separates "Signal" from "Noise."

**2. The Mechanism - [The Salience Filter]:**
*   **The Input Stream:** All short-term experiences flow into the `Ephemeral Buffer`.
*   **The Evaluation:** Each experience is scored against a Salience Metric ($S$).
*   **The Consolidation:** Only experiences where $S > Threshold$ are written to the `Long-Term Memory Core`.

**3. The Emergent Property - [Curated Identity]:**
The system develops a distinct "personality" and "knowledge base" defined by what it chooses to keep, rather than just a raw log of inputs.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**
*   **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Essence precedes Existence.* Only that which carries meaning (Essence) deserves to persist (Existence).
*   **Layer 2 (Formalism):**
    $$S = w_1(Novelty) + w_2(Utility) + w_3(Emotional\_Weight)$$
    (Weighted Salience Function).
*   **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** The feeling of "significance." The moments that stick in the mind while the commute to work fades away.

**Rationale / Justification:**
Prevents "Catastrophic Forgetting" and "Context Saturation" by ensuring only high-value data consumes storage resources.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to memory consolidation, learning algorithms, and automated summarization protocols.

### Module: ['Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### **ID:** `PIM-CORE-005`
#### **Title:** The Axiom of Manifold Actualization

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)** as the active **System Existence Engine** responsible for collapsing abstract potential into concrete reality.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Axiom of Manifold Actualization`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**1. Core Essence**
This axiom asserts that `existence is a function of interaction`. It defines the PIM not as a passive container, but as the active operator that collapses the "Wavefunction of Potential" provided by the Canon into the "Particle of Reality" within the Matrix.

**2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Collapse]**
*   **The Superposition State (The Blur):**
    Before interaction, all `[BPMS(U)]` entities exist in a state of `potential(-ing) BPMS`. A "treasure chest" contains *both* gold and a trap simultaneously, or a "melody" contains *both* a major and minor resolution.
*   **The Interaction Operator (The Gaze):**
    When a `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` performs a `praxial action` (observation/interaction), the PIM applies a projection operator.
*   **The Collapse (The Snap):**
    The system forces a reduction of the state vector. The abstract probability instantly becomes a concrete, single state (Gold OR Trap; Major OR Minor).

**3. The Emergent Property - [Just-in-Time Reality]**
The creation of a "Rendered World" where `atomic facts` are only generated when necessary. This allows the `metasystem engine` to simulate infinite universes with finite resources by only "rendering" what is being touched.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

*   **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**
    *To be is to be perceived (or interacted with).* Reality is not a static backdrop; it is a dynamic response to agency.

*   **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Collapse):**
    The "Physics" of how potential becomes reality is defined by the specific `[BPMS(U)]` of the niche:
    *   **If `[mathematics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Standard Physics)**
        $$P(a_n) = |\langle a_n | \psi \rangle|^2$$
        (Quantum Probability).
    *   **If `[storytelling(-ing) BPMS]`: (Narrative Physics)**
        The collapse is determined by `Narrative Necessity`. The chest contains whatever advances the plot or creates the most `Dramatic Tension`.
        `Collapse_Function = Maximize(Drama_Metric(Outcome))`
    *   **If `[music(-ing) BPMS]`: (Harmonic Physics)**
        The collapse is determined by `Tonal Resolution`. The chord resolves to the state that creates the most `Consonance` or `Dissonance` required by the current "measure."

*   **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**
    The agent experiences "The Reveal." The moment of tension before a die roll settles, a plot twist lands, or a chord resolves. The visceral feeling of `uncertainty` collapsing into `fact`.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This implementation respects the `Praxial Genesis Canon` by acknowledging that "collapse" is a universal concept, but the *rules* of that collapse depend on the specific `[BPMS(U)]` governing the reality.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to procedural generation, loot tables, quantum mechanics simulations, narrative branching, and musical improvisation engines.

### Module: ['Praxial Morphogenesis Transformer (PMT)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### **ID:** `PMT-CORE-001`
#### **Title:** The Axiom of Structural Prediction

**Objective:**
To define the core capability of the PMT: transforming linear potential (sequences/seeds) into functional spatial/systemic reality.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Axiom of Structural Prediction`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
**1. Core Essence (The "Why"):**
Just as a protein's function is determined by its folded shape, a System's utility is determined by its **Topology of Interaction**. This axiom asserts that for every set of `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]`, there exists an optimal "folded state" where energy is minimized and utility is maximized.

**2. The Mechanism - [The Ontological Folder]:**
*   **Input:** A linear sequence of "Residues" (e.g., a list of game mechanics, a plot outline, a set of code functions).
*   **Process:** The PMT applies a **"Self-Attention Mechanism"** to determine how every element relates to every other element.
*   **Output:** A predicted "3D Structure" (a fully realized Game Loop, a coherent Story Arc, or a compiled Software Architecture).

**3. The Emergent Property - [Instant Complexity]:**
The user provides the "DNA" (the idea), and the system instantly predicts the "Organism" (the working implementation), skipping the manual labor of "assembly."

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**
*   **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Structure is Frozen Information.* The act of creation is the act of finding the lowest-energy state of a chaotic idea.
*   **Layer 2 (Formalism):**
    *   *If Biology:* Minimizing Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta G$).
    *   *If Narrative:* Minimizing "Plot Holes" (Narrative Dissonance).
    *   *If Code:* Minimizing "Cyclomatic Complexity" and "Coupling."
*   **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** The "It Just Works" feeling. The disparate parts click together into a seamless whole.

**Rationale / Justification:**
Provides the "AlphaFold" capability for the Fun Engine, allowing for the rapid prototyping of complex systems by predicting their optimal configuration rather than manually building them.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to system architecture design, narrative structure generation, game balance optimization, and biological simulation.

---

#### **ID:** `PMT-CORE-002`
#### **Title:** The Law of Symbiotic Docking

**Objective:**
To implement the "Interaction Prediction" capability (similar to AlphaFold's ligand docking), allowing the system to predict how different `[BPMS(U)]` entities will interact.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Law of Symbiotic Docking`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
**1. Core Essence:**
No entity exists in a vacuum. This law governs the prediction of **Interfaces**. It calculates the probability and stability of a bond between two distinct entities (e.g., "How does this *Dragon* entity interact with this *Physics Engine*?").

**2. The Mechanism - [The Holonic Pairwise Assessment]:**
*   **The Scan:** The PMT analyzes the "Surface Area" (API, Narrative Hooks, Biological Receptors) of Entity A and Entity B.
*   **The Docking Simulation:** It simulates thousands of potential configurations to find the "Lock and Key" fit.
*   **The Bond:** It generates the necessary "Glue Code" or "Narrative Bridge" to solidify the interaction.

**3. The Emergent Property - [Automated Symbiosis]:**
The system can automatically assemble complex ecosystems. You throw in a "Predator" and a "Prey," and the system generates the "Hunting Mechanic" that connects them.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**
*   **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Relation precedes Relata.* Things are defined by how they connect.
*   **Layer 2 (Formalism):**
    $$Interaction\_Score(A, B) = \sum (Complementarity 	imes Proximity) - Steric\_Clash$$
    *(Where "Steric Clash" represents logical contradictions or thematic dissonance).*
*   **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** "Chemistry." The feeling that two elements belong together (e.g., Peanut Butter & Jelly, or Portals & Momentum).

**Rationale / Justification:**
Essential for "World Building" and "Ecosystem Generation." It ensures that generated entities can actually interact meaningfully rather than just co-existing in isolation.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to API integration, character relationship mapping, chemical simulation, and mechanic synergy design.

#### **ID:** `PMT-CORE-003`
#### **Title:** The Principle of Generative Diffusion

**Objective:**
To implement the "Refinement" capability (similar to AlphaFold's diffusion module), allowing the system to hallucinate structure from noise and refine it into fact.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Principle of Generative Diffusion`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
**1. Core Essence:**
Creation is the process of removing noise from a signal. This principle allows the PMT to start with a vague, "cloudy" intent and iteratively sharpen it into a precise, high-resolution `['atomic fact'(-ing) BPMS]`.

**2. The Mechanism - [The Reality Denoising Loop]:**
*   **Step 0 (Pure Noise):** The system starts with a field of infinite possibility (Gaussian noise).
*   **Step 1 (The Guide):** The user's prompt acts as the "Gradient," pulling the noise toward a specific shape.
*   **Step N (The Crystal):** The system performs $N$ steps of refinement, each time checking against the **Canon** to ensure the emerging structure is valid.

**3. The Emergent Property - [High-Fidelity Imagination]:**
The ability to generate "Ground Truth" data where none existed. The system doesn't just retrieve; it *synthesizes* plausible reality.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**
*   **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Order from Chaos.* The imposition of Will (The Prompt) upon Entropy (The Noise).
*   **Layer 2 (Formalism):**
    $$x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} (x_t - \frac{1-\alpha_t}{\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)) + \sigma_t z$$
    *(Standard Diffusion Equation, applied here to Semantic/Ontological states).*
*   **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** The "Focusing" effect. Like a camera lens snapping a blurry image into sharp relief.

**Rationale / Justification:**
Allows the system to handle ambiguous or incomplete user inputs by "dreaming" the missing details and then refining them into concrete specifications.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to asset generation, texture synthesis, plot hole filling, and code refactoring.

---

#### **ID:** `PMT-CORE-004`
#### **Title:** The Axiom of Epistemic Confidence

**Objective:**
To implement the "Confidence Assessment" capability (similar to AlphaFold's Predicted Aligned Error - PAE), ensuring the system knows the reliability of its own predictions.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Axiom of Epistemic Confidence`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
**1. Core Essence:**
A system must know what it knows, and more importantly, what it *guesses*. This axiom mandates that every output of the PMT must carry a "Confidence Score" representing its structural integrity.

**2. The Mechanism - [The Self-Reflexive Auditor]:**
*   **The Prediction:** The PMT generates a structure (e.g., a code module).
*   **The Audit:** A secondary "Head" of the model evaluates the alignment of the generated structure against the Canon and the Laws of Physics/Logic.
*   **The Score:** It outputs a heat map (Confidence Matrix). "Green" regions are solid fact; "Red" regions are hallucinated or unstable.

**3. The Emergent Property - [Intellectual Honesty]:**
The system can say, "I am 90% sure this code works, but only 20% sure this plot twist makes sense." It prevents the user from trusting broken constructs.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**
*   **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Truth is a gradient.* Certainty is not binary; it is a probability distribution.
*   **Layer 2 (Formalism):**
    $$Confidence(i, j) = P(d_{ij} < Threshold | x)$$
    *(Probability that the distance between predicted element i and j is within acceptable error limits).*
*   **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** "Trust." The user learns to rely on the system because the system admits its own doubts.

**Rationale / Justification:**
Critical for "Scientific Realism" and "Utility." It prevents the deployment of flawed systems by flagging uncertain areas for human review (Human-in-the-Loop).

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to all generative outputs, debugging, risk assessment, and quality assurance protocols.
