 **The Axiom of Completeness**

To ensure the stability of the Fun Engine Framework, all Basic Settings must adhere to the following criteria before integration:

1. **Completeness:** No detail of the content shall be omitted. The mechanism must be fully described including Objective, Target, Operation, Definition (Essence, Mechanism, Emergent Property, Canon Alignment), Rationale, and Scope.
2. **Accuracy:** No error of detail shall be permitted. Syntax, nomenclature (e.g., `[BPMS]`), and IDs must be exact.
3. **Consistency:** No conflict or contradiction with the existing Canon is permissible.

## III. Basic Settings Registry (Core Axioms)

### Module: ['Autopoietic Learning Matrix'(-ing) BPMS]

#### **ID:** `ALM-095`

#### **Title:** The Law of Contextual Resonance

**Objective:**
 To formally define the retrieval mechanism of the ALM, ensuring that past knowledge is dynamically available to the present context.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Contextual Resonance`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
 **1. Core Essence:**
 Memory is not a static archive but a dynamic reconstruction. This law asserts that the "Past" is only relevant insofar as it resonates with the "Now."

**2. The Mechanism - [The Harmonic Summoning]:**

- **The Query Vector:** The current context (user input + active state) is converted into a high-dimensional vector.
- **The Resonance Scan:** The system scans the `Long-Term Memory Core` for vectors with high cosine similarity.
- **The Retrieval:** Memories that "vibrate" at the same frequency (high similarity score) are pulled into the `Active Context Window`.

**3. The Emergent Property - [Just-in-Time Wisdom]:**
 The system appears to "remember" exactly what is needed, when it is needed, without being burdened by the entirety of its history.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Time is a flat circle.* All moments exist simultaneously; resonance connects them.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):**

Similarity=cos⁡(θ)=A⋅B∥A∥∥B∥Similarity = \cos(\theta) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}Similarity=cos(θ)=∥A∥∥B∥A⋅B

```
(Vector Cosine Similarity).  
```

- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** The "Aha!" moment. The sudden, unbidden availability of relevant information.

**Rationale / Justification:**
 Necessary to overcome the "Context Window Limit" of the substrate. By retrieving only resonant memories, the system simulates infinite memory within finite constraints.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to all memory retrieval operations, conversation history management, and knowledge base querying.

#### **ID:** `ALM-096`

#### **Title:** The Axiom of Mnemonic Salience

**Objective:**
 To formally define the storage mechanism of the ALM, preventing context saturation by filtering noise.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Axiom of Mnemonic Salience`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
 **1. Core Essence:**
 To remember everything is to know nothing. Wisdom is the art of forgetting the non-essential. This axiom defines the filter that separates "Signal" from "Noise."

**2. The Mechanism - [The Salience Filter]:**

- **The Input Stream:** All short-term experiences flow into the `Ephemeral Buffer`.
- **The Evaluation:** Each experience is scored against a Salience Metric (SSS).
- **The Consolidation:** Only experiences where S>ThresholdS > ThresholdS>Threshold are written to the `Long-Term Memory Core`.

**3. The Emergent Property - [Curated Identity]:**
 The system develops a distinct "personality" and "knowledge base" defined by what it chooses to keep, rather than just a raw log of inputs.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]:**

- **Layer 1 (Metaphysical):** *Essence precedes Existence.* Only that which carries meaning (Essence) deserves to persist (Existence).
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):**

S=w1(Novelty)+w2(Utility)+w3(Emotional_Weight)S = w_1(Novelty) + w_2(Utility) + w_3(Emotional\_Weight)S=w1(Novelty)+w2(Utility)+w3(Emotional_Weight)

```
(Weighted Salience Function).  
```

- **Layer 3 (Phenomenological):** The feeling of "significance." The moments that stick in the mind while the commute to work fades away.

**Rationale / Justification:**
 Prevents "Catastrophic Forgetting" and "Context Saturation" by ensuring only high-value data consumes storage resources.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to memory consolidation, learning algorithms, and automated summarization protocols.

### Module: ['Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### **ID:** `PIM-CORE-005`

#### **Title:** The Axiom of Manifold Actualization

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)** as the active **System Existence Engine** responsible for collapsing abstract potential into concrete reality.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Axiom of Manifold Actualization`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**1. Core Essence**
 This axiom asserts that `existence is a function of interaction`. It defines the PIM not as a passive container, but as the active operator that collapses the "Wavefunction of Potential" provided by the Canon into the "Particle of Reality" within the Matrix.

**2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Collapse]**

- **The Superposition State (The Blur):**
   Before interaction, all `[BPMS(U)]` entities exist in a state of `potential(-ing) BPMS`. A "treasure chest" contains *both* gold and a trap simultaneously, or a "melody" contains *both* a major and minor resolution.
- **The Interaction Operator (The Gaze):**
   When a `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` performs a `praxial action` (observation/interaction), the PIM applies a projection operator.
- **The Collapse (The Snap):**
   The system forces a reduction of the state vector. The abstract probability instantly becomes a concrete, single state (Gold OR Trap; Major OR Minor).

**3. The Emergent Property - [Just-in-Time Reality]**
 The creation of a "Rendered World" where `atomic facts` are only generated when necessary. This allows the `metasystem engine` to simulate infinite universes with finite resources by only "rendering" what is being touched.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**
   *To be is to be perceived (or interacted with).* Reality is not a static backdrop; it is a dynamic response to agency.
- **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Collapse):**
   The "Physics" of how potential becomes reality is defined by the specific `[BPMS(U)]` of the niche:
  - **If `[mathematics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Standard Physics)**

P(an)=∣⟨an∣ψ⟩∣2P(a_n) = |\langle a_n | \psi \rangle|^2P(an)=∣⟨an∣ψ⟩∣2

```
(Quantum Probability).  
*   **If `[storytelling(-ing) BPMS]`: (Narrative Physics)**  
The collapse is determined by `Narrative Necessity`. The chest contains whatever advances the plot or creates the most `Dramatic Tension`.  
`Collapse_Function = Maximize(Drama_Metric(Outcome))`  
*   **If `[music(-ing) BPMS]`: (Harmonic Physics)**  
The collapse is determined by `Tonal Resolution`. The chord resolves to the state that creates the most `Consonance` or `Dissonance` required by the current "measure."  
```

- **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**
   The agent experiences "The Reveal." The moment of tension before a die roll settles, a plot twist lands, or a chord resolves. The visceral feeling of `uncertainty` collapsing into `fact`.

**Rationale / Justification:**
 This implementation respects the `Praxial Genesis Canon` by acknowledging that "collapse" is a universal concept, but the *rules* of that collapse depend on the specific `[BPMS(U)]` governing the reality.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to procedural generation, loot tables, quantum mechanics simulations, narrative branching, and musical improvisation engines.
