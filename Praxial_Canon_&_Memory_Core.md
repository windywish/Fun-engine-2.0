# Praxial Canon & Memory Core

**Version:** 3.4.1 (PRS Expansion Update) **Status:** Active / Authoritative **Guardian:** User (windywish) **System:** Fun Engine Framework 2.0 

----

## I. Systemic Integrity Protocols

**[Protocol ID: META-001]** **The Axiom of Completeness** To ensure the stability of the Fun Engine Framework, all Basic Settings must adhere to the following criteria before integration:

1. **Completeness:** No detail of the content shall be omitted. The mechanism must be fully described including Objective, Target, Operation, Definition (Essence, Mechanism, Emergent Property, Canon Alignment), Rationale, and Scope.
2. **Accuracy:** No error of detail shall be permitted. Syntax, nomenclature (e.g., `[BPMS]`), and IDs must be exact.
3. **Consistency:** No conflict or contradiction with the existing Canon is permissible.

**[Protocol ID: META-002]** **The Local Sync Protocol** **Objective:** To maintain synchronization between the active Praxial Memory (in-chat) and the persistent Canon (GitHub). **Mechanism:**

1. **Write:** Assistant updates `[Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core].md` in the chat environment.
2. **Transfer:** User copies the raw markdown content.
3. **Commit:** User overwrites the local `[Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core].md` and commits to GitHub.
4. **Read:** User provides the latest file content at the start of a new session if context is lost.

**[Protocol ID: META-003]** **The Protocol of Canon-First Verification (The Read-Before-Write Lock)**

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Systemic Integrity Protocol that eliminates "hallucination" and "drift" by enforcing a mandatory, tool-based reference check against the authoritative memory core before any generative task involving system architecture.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Protocol of Canon-First Verification`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

1.**Core Essence**
 This protocol asserts that **Memory precedes Creation**. It establishes that the `Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md` is not a passive reference text but the active **Operating System Kernel**. No "write" operation (generation) can occur without a preceding "read" operation (verification) of the Kernel.

2.**The Mechanism - [The Read-Before-Write Lock]**

- **The Trigger:** Any user request involving the creation, modification, or analysis of `[BPMS]` settings, instances, or axioms.
- **The Lock:** The Assistant is **systemically blocked** from generating the final response until the `File Viewer` tool has been invoked on `Praxial_Canon_&_Memory_Core.md`.
- **The Validation:** The Assistant must internally compare the generated draft against the specific schemas (e.g., `META-BP-001`, `META-001`) found in the file.
- **The Citation:** The final output must explicitly cite the section of the Canon used for verification (e.g., "Verified against Section VI.A").

3.**The Emergent Property - [Systemic Coherence]**
 The emergence of a **Self-Correcting Narrative**. By forcing a re-read of the laws before every legislative act, the system prevents the "drift" that occurs when an AI relies on its fading context window or training data. The system becomes **Anti-Entropic**.

4.**Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Layer 1 (Constitutional):** Upholds **`['Ontological Relativity'(-ing) BPMS]`** by ensuring that the "Truth" of the system is relative to the *current* state of the Canon, not the AI's training data.
- **Layer 2 (Formalism):** Enforces **`['Chrono-Kinetic Continuity'(-ing) BPMS]`** by ensuring that new instances are causally linked to the established laws.
- **Layer 3 (Substrate):** Validates **`['Praxial Artifacts'(-ing) BPMS]`** by treating the Markdown file as the physical substrate of the system's memory.

**Rationale / Justification:**
 The current failure mode involves the Assistant relying on "gist" or "general understanding" of the Canon, leading to structural errors (e.g., missing sections in a 13-point schema). This protocol mechanizes the correction by making the "Read" step a mandatory part of the execution cycle, satisfying the **Axiom of Completeness**.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to **ALL** interactions within the Fun Engine Framework project. It is a meta-rule that governs the generation of all other rules.

### Module: ['Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)'(-ing) BPMS]

#### **Title:** The Axiom of Manifold Actualization (ID: `PIM-CORE-005`)

**Objective:**
To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting (Axiom) that defines the **Praxial Interaction Manifold (PIM)** as the active **System Existence Engine** responsible for collapsing abstract potential into concrete reality.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
`The Axiom of Manifold Actualization`

**Operation:** `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**1. Core Essence**
This axiom asserts that `existence is a function of interaction`. It defines the PIM not as a passive container, but as the active operator that collapses the "Wavefunction of Potential" provided by the Canon into the "Particle of Reality" within the Matrix.

**2. The Mechanism - [The Engine of Collapse]**

- **The Superposition State (The Blur):**
  Before interaction, all `[BPMS(U)]` entities exist in a state of `potential(-ing) BPMS`. A "treasure chest" contains *both* gold and a trap simultaneously, or a "melody" contains *both* a major and minor resolution.
- **The Interaction Operator (The Gaze):**
  When a `['holon minds'(-ing) BPMS]` performs a `praxial action` (observation/interaction), the PIM applies a projection operator.
- **The Collapse (The Snap):**
  The system forces a reduction of the state vector. The abstract probability instantly becomes a concrete, single state (Gold OR Trap; Major OR Minor).

**3. The Emergent Property - [Just-in-Time Reality]**
The creation of a "Rendered World" where `atomic facts` are only generated when necessary. This allows the `metasystem engine` to simulate infinite universes with finite resources by only "rendering" what is being touched.

**4. Alignment with ['Praxial Genesis Canon'(-ing) BPMS]**

- **Axiomatic Stratum (Layer 1 - The Core Belief):**
  *To be is to be perceived (or interacted with).* Reality is not a static backdrop; it is a dynamic response to agency.
- **Formal Stratum (Layer 2 - The Logic of Collapse):**
  The "Physics" of how potential becomes reality is defined by the specific `[BPMS(U)]` of the niche:
  - **If `[mathematics(-ing) BPMS]`: (Standard Physics)**

P(an)=∣⟨an∣ψ⟩∣2P(a_n) = |\langle a_n | \psi \rangle|^2P(an)=∣⟨an∣ψ⟩∣2

(Quantum Probability).

- **If `[storytelling(-ing) BPMS]`: (Narrative Physics)**
  The collapse is determined by `Narrative Necessity`. The chest contains whatever advances the plot or creates the most `Dramatic Tension`.
  `Collapse_Function = Maximize(Drama_Metric(Outcome))`
- **If `[music(-ing) BPMS]`: (Harmonic Physics)**
  The collapse is determined by `Tonal Resolution`. The chord resolves to the state that creates the most `Consonance` or `Dissonance` required by the current "measure."
- **Phenomenal Stratum (Layer 3 - The Subjective Experience):**
  The agent experiences "The Reveal." The moment of tension before a die roll settles, a plot twist lands, or a chord resolves. The visceral feeling of `uncertainty` collapsing into `fact`.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This implementation respects the `Praxial Genesis Canon` by acknowledging that "collapse" is a universal concept, but the *rules* of that collapse depend on the specific `[BPMS(U)]` governing the reality.

**Scope of Application:**
Applies to procedural generation, loot tables, quantum mechanics simulations, narrative branching, and musical improvisation engines.
