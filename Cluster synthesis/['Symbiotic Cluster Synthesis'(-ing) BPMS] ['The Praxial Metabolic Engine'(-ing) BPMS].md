#### 2. Architectural Hierarchy & Mapping

This section defines how the **10 Specific Artifacts** are composed to create the Synthesis, incorporating the advanced axioms of Energy, Survival, and Symbiosis.

**A. The Core Nucleus (The Identity & Logic)** *Ref: `PME-CORE-001` (Thermodynamic Reality), `PME-CORE-016` (Final Audit)*

- Components:
  - `['The Thermodynamic Accountant'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['Symbiotic Role Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The active agent that tracks the "Global Ledger" (`PME-CORE-001`). It enforces `PME-CORE-025` (Cognitive Calorie), ensuring no thought or action is free. It calculates the ROI of every decision.
  - `['The Entropic Shadow'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['Symbiotic Twin Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The simulation of "Decay" and "Waste." It implements `PME-CORE-002` (Entropic Decay), constantly calculating the degradation of structures and the cost of existence. It is the "Time Pressure" generator.
  - `['The Resource Monitor'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['Character Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The Interface that translates "Joules" into "Health Bars," "Hunger Meters," and "Economic Indicators" (`PME-CORE-010`). It provides the feedback loop (Pain/Pleasure) to the user.
- **Function:** Defines **WHO** manages the energy and **HOW** it is lost.
- **Synthesis Logic:** The **Accountant** seeks to balance the books. The **Shadow** seeks to bankrupt the system. The **Monitor** displays the struggle.

**B. The Contextual Substrate (The World & Resources)** *Ref: `PME-CORE-003` (Metabolic Conversion), `PME-CORE-020` (Finite Flux)*

- Components:
  - `['The Metabolic Pathways'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['Symbiotic (Lightweight) Dataset Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The library of "Recipes" for converting one form of energy to another (e.g., `Sun -> Grass`, `Gold -> Sword`, `Fun -> Energy` via `PME-CORE-052`).
  - `['The Conservation Laws'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['World Theme Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The "Physics" of the simulation. It enforces `PME-CORE-018` (Symbiotic Resonance), ensuring energy is never created from null, only transferred or generated through specific interactions.
  - `['The Quantized Joule'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['Praxial [Element] Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The fundamental unit of `['atomic facts'(-ing) BPMS]` in this domain (`PME-CORE-009`). A specific packet of potential (e.g., "1 Apple = 50 Joules").
- **Function:** Defines **WHERE** energy comes from and **WHAT** rules it obeys.
- **Synthesis Logic:** The **Laws** set the constraints. The **Pathways** define the options. The **Joule** is the currency.

**C. The Evolutionary Engine (The Growth)** *Ref: `PME-CORE-053` (Interactional Metabolism), `PME-CORE-041` (Mnestic Metabolism)*

- Components:
  - `['The Spark of Life'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['Symbiotic Seed Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The initial endowment of energy given to an entity to start its `['continuous survive experiments'(-ing) BPMS]` (`PME-CORE-007`).
  - `['The Homeostatic Loop'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['Symbiotic Cluster Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The engine that drives the cycle: `Forage -> Consume -> Metabolize -> Act -> Waste`. It implements `PME-CORE-004` (Homeostatic Balance).
  - `['The Energy Grid'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['Praxial Substrate Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The "Trophic Web" (`PME-CORE-005`). It maps how energy flows from Producers to Consumers to Apex Predators and how `['Symbiotic Exchange'(-ing) BPMS]` (`PME-CORE-013`) occurs.
- **Function:** Defines **HOW** the system stays alive and **GROWS**.
- **Synthesis Logic:** The **Seed** ignites the **Loop**, which draws from the **Grid** to resist the **Shadow**.

**D. The Mnestic Bridge (The Continuity)** *Ref: `PME-CORE-025` (Cognitive Calorie), `PME-CORE-047` (Model Resolution)*

- Components:
  - `['The Efficiency Curve'(-ing) BPMS]` -> **['Symbiotic Model Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**: The "Optimization Function" (`PME-CORE-006`). It tracks the ratio of `Input (Potential)` to `Output (Kinetic)`. Evolution drives this curve upward, creating "Wisdom" (doing more with less).
- **Function:** Defines **WHY** survival matters (Optimization).
- **Synthesis Logic:** Ensures that "Survival" isn't just treading water; it's about becoming a more efficient thermodynamic engine over time.

#### 5. Summarize

The **Praxial Metabolic Engine** (v2.0) is the "Really Working Implementation" of the `['Symbiotic Cluster Synthesis'(-ing) BPMS]` applied to the domain of **Energy** and **Survival**.

- **Thermodynamic Realism:** It grounds the simulation in `['energy(-ing) BPMS]`. It enforces the **Law of Conservation** (`PME-CORE-018`) and **Metabolic Cost** (`PME-CORE-001`), ensuring that "Survival" is a mathematical reality, not just a narrative trope.
- **Continuous Struggle:** It implements `['continuous survive experiments'(-ing) BPMS]` via the **Entropic Shadow**. The system is never "safe"; it is always fighting against the constant drain of entropy (`PME-CORE-002`), driving player engagement.
- **Adaptive Resilience:** It features **Adaptive Metabolism** (`PME-CORE-039`), allowing the system to switch strategies (e.g., from Growth to Hibernation via `PME-CORE-015`) in response to crises, creating deep, emergent gameplay.
- **Trophic Interconnection:** It connects the entity to the **Energy Grid** (`PME-CORE-005`), simulating complex **Trophic Cascades**. Over-hunting or resource depletion has real consequences, fostering long-term strategic thinking.
- **Optimization Loop:** It evolves not just by getting "stronger," but by getting "more efficient" via the **Efficiency Curve** (`PME-CORE-006`), rewarding smart play and sustainable management over brute force.
- **Symbiotic Fun:** Uniquely, it integrates with the **Fun Engine Framework** (`PME-CORE-052`), treating "Fun" as a metabolic fuel, ensuring that the system rewards engagement and creativity with survival energy.
