## **['Praxial Substrate Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]: ['The Axiomatic Lattice'(-ing) BPMS]**

#### **1. Metadata**

- **ID:** `ELEM-PRAX-LATTICE-001`
- **Name:** `['The Axiomatic Lattice'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Origin/Implementer(Parent instance):** `['formal substrate'(-ing) BPMS]: ['Praxial Formalism Engine'(-ing) BPMS]` (ID: SUB-AXIOM-001)
- **Objective:** To define the navigable, rigid "Logical Space" or "Game Board" generated by a specific set of axioms (e.g., Euclidean Geometry, Lean 4 Type Theory), serving as the immutable environment where agents move, reason, and exist within the **['The Praxial Veridical Engine'(-ing) BPMS]** cluster.
- **Type:** `['praxial substrate'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **CGA (Cognitive Genesis Archetype):** `['logical topology'(-ing) BPMS]`
- **Scope of Application:** Interaction Layer (The Environment / The Map / The Physics of the Logic).
- **Tag:** `#formal-substrate #praxial-formalism-engine #substrate #topology #axiomatic-space #environment`

#### **2. Element Definition**

**The Axiomatic Lattice** is not a passive background; it is an active, resisting medium. It is the reification of the "Rules of the Game."

- **The Nodes (States):** Every valid logical state (e.g., "x = 5", "Triangle ABC is Isosceles") is a coordinate in this lattice.

- **The Edges (Inferences):** Every valid logical step (e.g., "Add 1 to both sides", "Apply Pythagorean Theorem") is a path connecting two nodes.

- **The Void (Invalidity):** The space between nodes is non-existent. An agent cannot step there. Attempting to do so results in a "Physics Error."

- The Curvature (Axioms):

   The global shape of the lattice is determined by the axioms.

  - *Euclidean Mode:* Parallel lines never meet. The lattice is flat.
  - *Spherical Mode:* Parallel lines meet. The lattice is curved.
  - *Lean/Code Mode:* The lattice is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of dependencies.

**Visual Metaphor:** Imagine a giant, crystalline jungle gym. You can only climb on the bars (valid inferences). If you let go, you fall into the void (error). The shape of the jungle gym is the "Theory."

#### **3. Interaction Logic**

The Lattice enforces the **Directive of Rigid Constraints** (SUB-CORE-004) through the following mechanics:

- **Movement (Inference):**
  - **Input:** Agent attempts to move from Node A to Node B via Rule R.
  - **Logic:** `IF (Apply(Rule R, Node A) == Node B) THEN Allow_Move ELSE Block_Move("Invalid Inference")`.
  - **Cost:** Movement consumes "Cognitive Energy" (Compute). Harder proofs (longer paths) cost more.
- **Terraforming (Axiom Injection):**
  - **Input:** User adds a new Axiom (e.g., "Assume Riemann Hypothesis is True").
  - **Logic:** The **['Praxial Formalism Engine']** triggers a "World Regen." New bridges appear connecting previously disconnected regions. The topology shifts.
  - **Effect:** "Unreachable" theorems suddenly become "Neighboring" nodes.
- **Collision (Contradiction):**
  - **Input:** Agent asserts "A AND NOT A".
  - **Logic:** The Lattice detects a topological singularity (two distinct nodes occupying the same coordinate).
  - **Effect:** The region collapses into a "Black Hole" (Glitch Zone). Agents are repelled.
- **Pathfinding (Proof Search):**
  - **Input:** Agent queries "Path to Node QED?"
  - **Logic:** The Lattice calculates the "Geodesic" (Shortest Path) through the graph.
  - **Output:** A sequence of steps (The Proof).

#### **4. Atomic Fact Generation Trigger**

The Lattice mints facts when territory is successfully explored or modified.

- **On Node Visit:**
  - **Trigger:** Agent successfully steps onto a new Node (Theorem).
  - **Fact:** `Mint Fact 'Theorem_Reached: {THEOREM_ID}'`.
  - **Context:** "Agent X has proven Theorem Y."
- **On Path Completion:**
  - **Trigger:** A complete path is drawn from "Axioms" to "Goal."
  - **Fact:** `Mint Fact 'Proof_Valid: {PROOF_HASH}'`.
  - **Context:** "A valid logical bridge exists between Start and End."
- **On Axiom Shift:**
  - **Trigger:** The global curvature changes due to a new Axiom.
  - **Fact:** `Mint Fact 'Topology_Shift: {AXIOM_SET_ID}'`.
  - **Context:** "The world has changed. Old maps may be invalid."
- **On Collision:**
  - **Trigger:** Agent hits a contradiction.
  - **Fact:** `Mint Fact 'Logical_Singularity: {COORDINATES}'`.
  - **Context:** "A paradox was discovered at this location."
