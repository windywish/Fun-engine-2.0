#### 2. Architectural Hierarchy & Mapping

This section defines the operational phases of the Neuro-Symbolic Interface, mapping its lifecycle from a static configuration to a dynamic engine of mathematical truth.

**A. The Artifactual Shell (The Mold)**

- **Definition:** The discrete container that shapes the raw intelligence of the **Foundation Oracle** into a focused "Mathematical Intuition." It filters out creative fiction and enforces logical rigor.
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic Model Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `Gemini 1.5 Pro / GPT-4o (Weights)` + `Chain-of-Thought Configuration`.
- **Implementation:** `MODEL-ART-CORE-021` (Axiom of Artifactual Existence) & `MODEL-ART-CORE-024` (Principle of Universal Implementation).
- **Result:** A secure, immutable object containing the "Logic" (System Prompt), "Knowledge" (Math ArXiv RAG), and "Constraints" (Formal Syntax).

**B. The Symbiotic Interface (The Service)**

- **Definition:** The active coupling layer between the **['Symbiotic Role Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]:['The Intuitive Prover']** and the Model. It translates the Role's "Need for a Proof" into a specific "Inference Request."
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic Model Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `Conjecture` + `Formal Context`.
- **Implementation:** `MODEL-ART-CORE-006` (Axiom of Conscious Service) & `MODEL-ART-CORE-015` (Teleological Alignment Protocol).
- **Result:** A "Conscious Partner" that understands the difference between a "Hint" and a "Solution," aligning its output with the rigorous demands of the **['Symbiotic Twin Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]**.

**C. The Evolutionary Core (The Brain)**

- **Definition:** The internal engine of learning that refines the model's "Intuition" based on the "Reality Checks" from the Symbolic Solver.
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic Model Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `Twin Feedback Loop` (Compiler Errors).
- **Implementation:** `MODEL-ART-CORE-007` (Protocol of Chrono-Symbiotic Evolution) & `MODEL-ART-CORE-011` (Veridical Evolution Loop).
- **Result:** A living system that learns from every compilation error (Fast Mode) and consolidates successful proof strategies into `['The Crystallized Wisdom'(-ing) BPMS]` (Slow Mode).
