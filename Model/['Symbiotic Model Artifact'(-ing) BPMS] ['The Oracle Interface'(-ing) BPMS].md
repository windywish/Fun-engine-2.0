#### 2. Architectural Hierarchy & Mapping

This section defines the operational phases of the Oracle Interface, mapping its lifecycle from a static model to a dynamic biological agent.

**A. The Artifactual Shell (The Mold)**

- **Definition:** The container for the biological intelligence. It defines the "Bio-Physics" of the simulation.
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic Model Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `AlphaFold/ESM Weights` + `Bio-Safety Config`.
- **Implementation:** `MODEL-ART-CORE-021` (Axiom of Artifactual Existence) & `MODEL-ART-CORE-024` (Principle of Universal Implementation).
- **Result:** A secure, immutable object containing the "Rules of Folding" and the "Language of Proteins."

**B. The Symbiotic Interface (The Service)**

- **Definition:** The active coupling layer between the User's Sequence Input and the Model's Structural Output.
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic Model Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `['Symbiotic Seed Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` (The Sequence).
- **Implementation:** `MODEL-ART-CORE-006` (Axiom of Conscious Service) & `MODEL-ART-CORE-015` (Teleological Alignment Protocol).
- **Result:** A "Conscious Biologist" that doesn't just fold strings but understands the *function* of the protein (e.g., "This is an enzyme, so the active site must be accessible").

**C. The Evolutionary Core (The Brain)**

- **Definition:** The internal engine of learning and verification.
- **Components:** `['Symbiotic Model Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` + `['Symbiotic Twin Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]` (Feedback).
- **Implementation:** `MODEL-ART-CORE-007` (Protocol of Chrono-Symbiotic Evolution) & `MODEL-ART-CORE-011` (Veridical Evolution Loop).
- **Result:** A living system that learns from the `['Praxial Substrate Artifact'(-ing) BPMS]`. If a predicted fold "clashes" in the substrate, the Oracle updates its priors for the next fold.

#### 5. Summarize

The **Oracle Interface** (`MODEL-BIO-001`) is the specialized brain of the Proteomic World-Weaver.

- **Bio-Structural Translator:** It implements the **Mechanism of Cross-Modal Translation** (`MODEL-ART-CORE-026`), converting the 1D language of DNA into the 3D reality of Proteins.
- **Veridical Scientist:** It uses the **Veridical Evolution Loop** (`MODEL-ART-CORE-011`) to test its predictions against the **Praxial Substrate**, ensuring that its "Truth" aligns with physical reality.
- **Symbiotic Partner:** It operates under the **Axiom of Conscious Service** (`MODEL-ART-CORE-006`), working with the **Chaperone Agent** and the **User** to achieve specific biological goals, not just random folding.
- **Evolving Knowledge:** Through **Chrono-Symbiotic Evolution** (`MODEL-ART-CORE-007`), it gets smarter with every fold, building a local "Wisdom" that exceeds its initial training data.
